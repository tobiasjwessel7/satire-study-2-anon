politics,Mali's leader dissolves political parties and bans meetings of their members,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2P32R2RQHUI7BBEYD6BBJO5C2I.jpg&w=1440,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/05/13/mali-political-parties-dissolve-military/d5eafc60-303d-11f0-8498-1f8214bba2d2_story.html,"BAMAKO, Mali — The president of Mali's transitional government signed a decree Tuesday dissolving political parties amid a backdrop of pro-democracy opposition, a minister in the government announced.
The decision by Gen. Assimi Goita comes amid a surge in kidnappings of pro-democracy activists in the capital Bamako and just days after a demonstration by several hundred pro-democracy activists.
'Political parties and organizations of a political nature are dissolved throughout the national territory,' announced Mamani Nassire, the minister delegate to the prime minister in charge of political reforms and support for the electoral process.
Nassire was reading from a decree signed by Goita on national TV. The decree was announced after an extraordinary council of ministers meeting Tuesday.
The decree reads: 'It is forbidden for members of dissolved political parties and political organizations to hold any meetings.'
For almost two weeks, political parties and pro-democracy activists have been demonstrating against the military government to prevent the signing of the decree . However, on Monday, the National Transition Council, Mali's transitional legislative body, voted in favor of the decree, which was adopted by the Council of Ministers last week.
'This decision deals a severe blow to the reconciliation process that began last year,' wrote Mali's former prime minister, Moussa Mara, on his X account.
Mali has been under military rule since a 2021 coup d'état led by Goita. In recent days, arrests of pro-democracy activists have multiplied in response to demonstrations. However, some political figures are planning to appeal to the Constitutional Court to overturn the transition chief's decision.
'Political parties are recognized by the Malian constitution, so we're going to take our case to the Constitutional Court to ensure our rights are upheld. In the meantime, we're going to continue our fight as a civil society and as citizens of this country for the country to run smoothly,' said Nouhoum Togo, president of the Union for the Safeguard of the Republic party, which ceased to exist after the law dissolving political parties.",n/a

politics,Shamelessness Is Trump's Superpower,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/13/multimedia/13edsall-jkbl/13edsall-jkbl-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/opinion/trump-corruption-politics.html,"Donald Trump, who was well on his way to becoming one of the most corrupt presidents in American history even before he said it would be 'stupid' for the United States not to accept a plane worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Qatar to replace Air Force One, repeatedly attacks his adversaries in part to mask his own violations of the law and the Constitution.
Donald Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, argued in an email that Trump's repeated description of Democrats and liberal programs as immoral is designed to win support for his agenda:
Identity politics, Moynihan wrote,
For Trump, Moynihan argued,
Trump does this, Moynihan wrote, 'even while making 'fraud' a central trope of his administration in order to justify cutting government services.'
During his first and second terms in office, Trump radically altered the Republican Party's moral guidelines to make self-enrichment a routine fact of political life.
Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University, is outspoken in his criticism of Trump.
'Trump,' Dallek wrote by email,
Trump's self-dealing, Dallek argued, has become part and parcel of his overwhelming assault on American laws and traditions:
In fact, Dallek argues that Trump uses his profiteering as a tool to mobilize supporters:
Sarah Kreps, a political scientist at Cornell, emailed her responses to my queries about Trump and corruption:
In this context, Kreps continued,
I asked Kreps and others whether Trump has been able to get away with self-dealing and profiting from his political position because he is so brazen — so transparent in his crypto deals and in the sale of Trump bibles and Trump sneakers, completely without guilt or shame.
Kreps replied:
Douglas Kriner, a political scientist at Cornell, elaborated on Kreps's point:
In seeking to explain the Democrats' vulnerability to Trump's attacks, Kriner cited Trump's 2024 transgender ads and their message that
The transgender commercials, Kriner argued, focused on
Trump's victories in 2016 and 2024, despite his liabilities, raise a significant question. Bo Rothstein, a political scientist at the University of Gothenburg, wrote by email:
After studying the link between corruption and social trust for three decades, Rothstein wrote, 'It has become clear to me that what most people see as corruption is not limited to bribes and kickbacks. Instead, what they react against is when the principle of impartiality in the implementation of policies is transgressed.'
A 2024 article by Rothstein, 'The Future for Social Democracy and the Challenge of Liberalism,' makes the case that
I asked a range of scholars for their assessment of Rothstein's analysis, his broad definition of corruption and the effect of Trump's transparent and guilt-free style. Their answers varied widely.
Moynihan argued that the view among conservative white people that Democratic policies are corrupt has been carefully cultured and nurtured by the MAGA movement:
Rothstein, Dallek contended, 'has a point. Democrats have allowed themselves to be painted as a party of special interests.' But, Dallek stressed, this portrayal of Democrats has been effective largely because it taps into the hatreds emerging under growing partisan animosity, with the result that for Republicans,
Stanley Feldman, a political scientist at Stony Brook University, provided more detail in an email on Dallek's point:
Trump, Feldman continued, 'does not think that anything he does to enrich himself is improper or, at a minimum, that anything that he will be held legally responsible for.'
Trump's belief in his ability to enrich himself without legal or political sanction has been reinforced by the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision, Feldman contended, and by the fact that 'he was re-elected after being found guilty of falsifying business records, defamation in the E. Jean Carroll case and financial statement fraud (as well as other indictments).'
Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, described the ongoing efforts of Trump and his allies in an email:
Trump, Jacobson said,
Jacobson wrote in a forthcoming paper:
Reinforcing Jacobson's argument, Jonathan Weiler, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, outlined in an email the sustained Republican effort to demonize political adversaries:
The focus on elite Democratic corruption, Weiler continued,
I asked Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T. and a recent Nobel laureate, what he thought of the high percentage of voters, Republicans and Democrats, who view the opposition party as corrupt. He replied by email:
At the same time, Acemoglu added,
Some of those I contacted were explicitly critical of Rothstein's arguments. Cindy Kam, a political scientist at Vanderbilt, wrote by email:
One thing is clear: Trump's sustained claims of Democratic and liberal corruption have not prevented the steady erosion of his status.
Since taking office, Trump's approval rating has been on a consistent downward trajectory, falling to 45.8 percent on May 12 from 50.5 percent on Jan. 27, according to RealClearPolitics. Over the same period, his disapproval rating rose to 50.1 percent from 44.3 percent.
Any normal — or rational — politician looking at those numbers would seriously consider a major shift in direction. Trump, however, is neither normal nor rational.",n/a

Judge Stefanie Moon and an investigative panel of the state Judicial Qualifications Commission on Wednesday filed a revised agreement, known as a stipulation, that went along with disciplinary measures suggested last week by the Supreme Court.
The Judicial Qualifications Commission in April recommended that Moon receive a public reprimand and pay a fine of $2,115, the amount of the political contributions. But the Supreme Court last week rejected that recommendation and said she should receive a suspension, along with being reprimanded and paying the fine.
Allegations of improper political contributions tied to Kamala Harris, Joe Biden
The commission last month filed documents at the Supreme Court that alleged Moon violated judicial canons by making political contributions, including to committees backing former Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, former President Joe Biden and ActBlue, a Democratic Party fundraising arm.
In addition, Moon was accused of reminding an attorney in court that he had not returned a phone call related to her re-election campaign and improperly contacting the therapist of a man who was a party in a case and whose mental health was an issue.
The commission makes recommendations to the Supreme Court, which has ultimate authority to discipline judges.",n/a
politics,Democrats Must Embrace Their Inner Jerry Springer,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/09/opinion/09neyfakh/09neyfakh-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/opinion/democrats-need-jerry-springer.html,"Given that Hollywood is often caricatured as a hotbed of liberalism, it's surprising that Republicans seem so much better than Democrats at the showbiz side of politics. Two Republican presidents have stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: Presidents Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, as does the former Republican governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Yet among liberals there persists a sense that running celebrities for public office is somehow déclassé, cynical or simply not something a serious party does.
The Democrats need to reckon with a new reality: The electorate wants to be entertained. Instead of continuing to run highly credentialed political lifers, the party needs to embrace the idea of the celebrity candidate — and find someone with sincerely-held progressive beliefs, sky-high name recognition and experience winning over the kinds of voters who've supported the MAGA movement. In other words, they need to find someone like Jerry Springer.
Mr. Springer, who died in 2023, is best known for his gleefully distasteful TV show, which for nearly three decades featured a parade of cheating spouses, incestuous siblings and rowdy strippers who routinely erupted in brutal onstage brawls. With his glasses, jacket and tie, Mr. Springer would hang back at a safe distance, an unlikely instigator standing amid a jeering crowd and politely asking questions.
Yes, that Jerry Springer should serve as a model for the kind of standard-bearer Democrats should be looking for: a professionally famous person with an intuitive grasp of attention, a flair for drama and conflict, and a proven ability to communicate with a broad audience regardless of its political affiliations.
As a celebrity, Mr. Springer had none of the glamour of, say, a Beyoncé, a George Clooney or a Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson — some of the names occasionally mentioned as possible political recruits. But that's the point. For Democrats, the issue of being perceived as talking down to voters is one that the party continues to struggle with. Many of the voters who improbably regard Mr. Trump, a gilded billionaire, as an everyman with a common touch, cheered for Mr. Springer because he seemed relatable and never condescending. That kind of figure, coupled with a talent for showmanship, might prove a recipe for success now, even more so than it did for Mr. Springer during the political career he began in advance of rising to fame as a talk-show host.
Before Mr. Springer became an icon of bad taste, and before his name — Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! — became a kind of tawdry war cry, he had a promising career in government. He was an idealistic and ambitious progressive reformer elected to office in Cincinnati, Ohio, during the 1970s as a city councilman. He appealed to countercultural college students and blue-collar workers alike. During his time in City Hall, he opposed the Vietnam War, led a successful campaign to create a city-owned bus system and advocated reforms at the local jail. He resigned from the City Council in 1974, following a prostitution scandal — a seeming career ender at the time, though one he came back from, successfully reclaiming his seat and then serving as mayor of Cincinnati.
Both his political gifts and his nose for spectacle would contribute to his rise as a big-tent TV celebrity. That tent included many of the kind of people Hillary Clinton would later label 'deplorables,' an infamous slight. Even as his studio audience — and many critics — sneered at Mr. Springer's guests and judged him for putting them on his televised circus, he always managed to seem genuinely interested in them: their feelings, their decisions and occasionally their hopes for the future.
After Mr. Springer ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in the Ohio governor's race in 1982, he essentially stumbled into a career in media — first as a pundit delivering commentaries on the news, then as an Emmy-winning evening news anchor, then, starting in 1991, as the host of a daytime talk show focused on current affairs and human interest stories.
After a stretch of incurably low ratings, 'The Jerry Springer Show' began its transformation into the shocking free-for-all that we remember, and he became an international celebrity. But he spent the rest of his life looking for ways to get back into politics, even as his infamy made the prospect less viable. He seriously explored running for statewide office again in Ohio during three separate election cycles, starting around the time of his show's commercial peak in the late 1990s. He found that neither voters nor party leaders were willing to look past his TV show: A University of Cincinnati poll in 2003 found that he had an unfavorability rating of 71 percent.
Many found the idea of Mr. Springer in the Senate not just implausible but offensive. Representative Ted Strickland, who would later become Ohio's governor, denounced Mr. Springer as someone 'who abuses damaged, vulnerable people for his own purpose' and swore he'd never share a stage with him.
Mr. Springer ended up not running in 2003, channeling his passion for politics into a radio show on Air America, the short-lived experiment in progressive talk radio. His radio show — on which he talked about issues like abortion, the death penalty and public education — aired alongside that of another entertainer turned political aspirant: the former 'Saturday Night Live' comedian and future senator from Minnesota, Al Franken.
It was in 2017, the year after Mr. Trump's election, that Mr. Springer and his inner circle of supporters thought perhaps his moment had finally come, and they began kicking the tires on a campaign for governor of Ohio. If Americans could be convinced to vote for one famous guy they'd seen on a cheesy TV show, why wouldn't they embrace another? As Mr. Springer said of Mr. Trump, 'His constituency is basically mine. These are fans of the show.'
Several of Mr. Springer's advisers told me that, in a general election, they had no doubt he would have won the Ohio statehouse, by bringing home the kinds of lifelong Democratic voters who had switched to Mr. Trump in 2016. An Ohio State senator, Bill DeMora, told me of Springer fans: 'They related to somebody like Jerry Springer, because he talked to them, not down to them.'
In hindsight, Mr. Springer's story lends credence to the notion that politics and entertainment have more in common than we like to admit. If nothing else, Democrats must get past their aversion to the unseriousness of celebrity and treat it as a selling point, not a stumbling block. Why not Oprah Winfrey? Or the ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith? Or the 'Shark Tank' personality and billionaire Mark Cuban? Just pick someone who's willing to run, who's good at their job, and who lots of people like. Democrats would do well not to let the next Jerry Springer slip away.",n/a
politics,"Rob Sand, Iowa's Only Democrat in Statewide Office, to Run for Governor",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/12nat-iowa-gov-1-zvwb/12nat-iowa-gov-1-zvwb-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/rob-sand-iowa-governor-democrats.html,"Rob Sand, Iowa's elected state auditor and the only Democrat now holding a major political office in the state, said on Monday that he would run for governor next year, boosting his party's hopes of gaining a policymaking foothold in a place that Republicans dominate.
Mr. Sand has won two statewide elections, but to become governor he would need to overcome a decade of political trends favoring Republicans. Since President Trump became the leader of the party, Iowa Republicans have amassed large legislative majorities and won all six seats in the state's congressional delegation.
The incumbent governor, Kim Reynolds, a Republican, said last month that she would not seek re-election to a third full term, setting up an open Republican primary that could attract several prominent conservatives.
Iowa is expected to be one of several Midwest states with closely contested governor's races next year. Republicans are hoping to capture governorships now held by Democrats in Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Mr. Sand has been a highly visible state auditor, examining state agencies and at times clashing with Ms. Reynolds. He has also worked to build a personal political brand that is distinct from his party. In his announcement video, posted to social media on Monday, he described his background as an auditor and prosecutor without once mentioning that he is a Democrat.
'I'm doing it because we need more public service and less politics,' Mr. Sand said in the video about his run for governor. 'A lot of politicians yap about making a place redder or bluer. I want Iowa to be better and truer.'
Iowa was once a swing state. Former President Barack Obama carried the state twice, and the Democrats had a majority in the State Senate until the 2016 election.
Under Ms. Reynolds, however, the state government has moved in a sharply conservative direction. Lawmakers have passed restrictions in recent years on abortion, transgender people and school library books, and have limited the power of Mr. Sand's office as auditor. So far, voters have rewarded the Republicans. Mr. Trump carried the state in each of the last three presidential elections, including by a 13-point margin in 2024.
Over that time, Mr. Sand has become a political outlier. Two other Democrats in statewide office, the treasurer and attorney general, lost their seats by narrow margins in the 2022 election. Mr. Sand won re-election that year by about 3,000 votes out of about 1.2 million cast.",n/a
politics,Today Harvard Is the Target. Tomorrow It Could Be Your Church.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/09/multimedia/09claybourn-czpl/09claybourn-czpl-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/opinion/trump-harvard-tax.html,"Conservatives like me once instinctively understood that expanding government power — even briefly — invites harm. Yet recent attempts by President Trump's administration to use the tax code as a weapon reveal how easily partisanship can override wisdom.
In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status as part of his feud with the school over its response to antisemitism and perceived ideological bias. On Wednesday, he floated the idea of stripping other universities of their exemptions. Meanwhile, the acting U.S. attorney in Washington, a Trump ally, accused Wikipedia's parent organization of allowing foreign propaganda and suggested that it, too, might be failing its obligations as a nonprofit.
Many on the right have welcomed these aggressive moves as overdue pushback against liberal dominance in academia and media. That's a mistake — one that conservatives could come to regret. Whether or not Mr. Trump ultimately succeeds, his attempt to weaponize the tax code sets a troubling and dangerous precedent.
If the executive branch can threaten Wikipedia and universities today, what would stop a leftist administration from targeting churches and synagogues tomorrow?
Imagine a scenario: It's 2029, and a progressive Democrat sits in the Oval Office. Federal auditors descend on evangelical churches after pastors preach that marriage should only be between a man and a woman, labeling their words 'political advocacy.' Synagogues face regulatory investigations for teachings on gender and sexuality that offend prevailing cultural orthodoxies. Faith-based charities, suddenly saddled with endless bureaucratic forms and invasive reporting requirements, find their missions suffocating beneath paperwork. Smaller congregations fold under legal expenses while larger institutions self-censor out of fear. Soon the pulpit is muted, faith leaders are intimidated into silence, and communities are stripped of their authentic voices.
Far-fetched? Hardly. Unchecked executive power rarely contracts voluntarily. Progressives have long advocated re-examining the tax-exempt status of religious institutions that engage with politically sensitive issues like same-sex marriage and abortion. Conservatives rightly condemned the Obama administration when the Internal Revenue Service selectively scrutinized conservative Tea Party groups that applied for tax-exempt status, subjecting them to prolonged bureaucratic hurdles and legal battles.
What we are seeing today under Mr. Trump, however, is of a different scale. This administration is engaging in administrative bias and openly using tax status threats as a political tool. It has elevated intimidation to official policy.
Such threats stand on dubious legal ground. Revoking tax-exempt status typically depends on clear-cut regulatory breaches or financial misconduct. These efforts have already ignited substantial backlash, and their ability to survive judicial scrutiny is doubtful.
Weaponizing tax policy to punish ideological opponents contradicts fundamental conservative principles about limiting government power. Conservatism insists that unchecked authority inevitably leads to abuse because human nature is inherently flawed and power corrupts easily. When government institutions — intended to be impartial guardians of law and order — are driven by partisan motives, they become instruments of oppression rather than protectors of liberty. This not only violates conservative ideals but also weakens public trust and undermines the very democratic institutions conservatives seek to preserve.
The wisest conservatives understood a simple truth: Preserving liberty demands practicing restraint, especially toward those you oppose. Ronald Reagan put it plainly when he said that freedom is 'never more than one generation away from extinction.' Cowing political adversaries through executive fiat may realize short-term gains, but it guarantees long-term peril.
America's constitutional order rests on self-restraint as well as on the formal separation of powers. Conservatives must resist today's easy victories for the sake of tomorrow's freedoms. The real safeguard against abuses is not simply legal boundaries but moral discipline. The preservation of our democratic institutions and constitutional freedoms demands that conservatives recommit practically, not just rhetorically, to the ideals of limited and responsible government.
It might seem fanciful to expect a Republican Party, still deeply enthralled by Mr. Trump's combative brand of politics, to suddenly reclaim this kind of governance. Yet even now, within the G.O.P., there is a group that clings stubbornly to the conservative traditions of prudence and restraint. Figures such as Representative Don Bacon, Senator Rand Paul, former Representative Justin Amash and the scholar Yuval Levin continue to advocate politics defined by modesty and self-control rather than raw power and retribution.
This group, though currently outshouted and overshadowed, understands that enduring influence is built on moral clarity and consistency, not momentary dominance. If these conservatives and others who share their values can muster the courage to resist the excesses of the status quo, they could yet become an essential force for restoring balance and integrity to our political life.
The alternative — unchecked cycles of ideological retribution — risks permanently destabilizing the political and social fabric that makes America exceptional. Conservatives bear a unique responsibility to champion restraint, ensuring that government remains a servant of liberty rather than its master.",n/a
sports,Portuguese title on the line as Benfica host rivals Sporting,https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KALYK5NIVNMMDFWCSQOCMWWLNQ.jpg?auth=85192040b330c7f275e8f26b55e84f6ac495e28d08cb7a27cfe2718d4735b982&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true,https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/portuguese-title-line-benfica-host-rivals-sporting-2025-05-08,"May 8 (Reuters) - Sporting and Benfica lock horns in a Lisbon derby on Saturday that could decide the Portuguese league title with a game left in one of the closest races the country has seen in years.
The Portuguese capital rivals both have 78 points, with Sporting top by virtue of winning the first clash between the teams 1-0 at the Jose Alvalade stadium back in December.
If Sporting win on Saturday they will be champions, while if Benfica triumph by at least a two-goal margin they will reclaim the title with a superior head-to-head record.
A one-goal victory for Benfica would mean the title being decided next weekend when goal difference could come into play, with Sporting currently three goals better off than Benfica.
If the match is drawn, Sporting will retain the title by at least matching their rival's result on the final matchday.
With third-placed Porto long out of the title race, trailing 13 points behind the top two and level on 65 points with Braga, the Lisbon rivalry between Benfica and Sporting has dominated the campaign and not only in the league.
Benfica beat Sporting on penalties in the League Cup final in January and they will meet again at the iconic Jamor National Stadium in the Portuguese Cup final on May 25.
It will be a clash of two coaches who took charge of struggling sides in mid-season and got them back on track.
Rui Borges in late December replaced Joao Pereira, who lasted only 42 days after he was named Sporting manager following Ruben Amorim's move to Manchester United.
Amorin left Sporting in comfortable position at the top but a series of bad results forced the club to make a quick change and hire the 43-year-old Borges from Vitoria Guimaraes.
Sporting were already feeling the heat from Bruno Lage's Benfica, who was hired in September for a second tenure after Roger Schmidt was fired only four matchdays into the season.",n/a
sports,President Donald Trump plans to create commission on college athletics: Sources,https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/05/07195107/GettyImages-2213213417-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6341165/2025/05/07/donald-trump-commission-on-college-athletics,"Former Alabama head coach Nick Saban and Texas Tech board of regents chairman Cody Campbell would co-chair the commission President Donald Trump is interested in forming to examine the long list of issues facing college sports, a source briefed on the plans told The Athletic.
The source said Trump is expected to be 'very engaged' with the commission because he sees the current state of college sports as an issue of national importance.

The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported Trump was interested in weighing in with an executive order after the president spoke last week with Saban, who has expressed concern that college sports is being harmed by the big money pouring into it to compensate athletes with little regulation. Yahoo! Sports first reported Wednesday that Trump is planning to create a presidential commission to examine a long list of issues facing college sports, from booster-funded payments and transfer rules to conference alignment and Title IX.
Campbell, who was elected chairman of the Texas Tech board of regents last month, is a former Red Raiders football player and one of the university's most prominent donors. He is the co-founder and co-executive of Double Eagle Energy Holdings, an upstream oil and gas company based out of Fort Worth, Texas, which operates extensively in the Permian Basin region of West Texas. Campbell is also the co-founder of the Matador Club, an NIL collective that supports Texas Tech athletics, and he recently spearheaded the new $242 million south endzone project at Tech's Jones AT&T Stadium, which overlooks Cody Campbell Field.
In February, Double Eagle sold a development for $4.1 billion, and in 2021, the company sold a previous development for $6.4 billion. Last month, Double Eagle announced a continued and expanded partnership with EnCap Investments, a prominent private equity company that specializes in the oil and gas industry. Campbell is a board member of Texas Public Policy Foundation and a distinguished fellow at the America First Policy Institute, the latter which has been integral to President Trump's second-term policy agenda.
A presidential commission would typically dig into various aspects of an issue or enterprise and deliver a report suggesting possible solutions that could involve executive and legislative action. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order creating the Religious Liberty Commission.

A spokeswoman for Rep. Michael Baumgartner, a freshman Republican from Washington who recently put forth an expansive bill to reform college sports, said he welcomed Trump's involvement.
'College sports is a highly subsidized public good and should be regulated like the public good it is. A presidential commission offers the chance to bring fiscal sanity; restore regional conferences and competitive balance; and protect the future of non-revenue and Olympic sports,' the spokeswoman said in a statement to The Athletic.
It's unclear how a commission would impact the current developments in college sports, including a potential landmark agreement to settle a trio of antitrust lawsuits facing the NCAA and major conferences and establish for the first time a system of direct payments from schools to athletes.
The settlement awaits final approval from a federal judge, who ordered the defendants to tweak part of the agreement that sets new roster limits for NCAA Division I schools that opt into the deal.
The latest revised filing has been made in the House v. NCAA settlement, regarding roster limits.

College sports leaders and attorneys for the defendants remain confident the judge will sign off on the deal.
Even if the settlement is approved, college sports leaders have acknowledged that it will need the backing of federal legislation, which they have been, for years, lobbying Congress for.
Tom McMillen, the former Democratic congressman who for several years led an association of athletic directors whose schools compete at the highest level of Division I, praised Trump for getting involved.

'I give President Trump a lot of credit. This is a time to bring the best minds in college sports together, in higher education, and figure a model out,' said McMillen, who has known Trump for more than 50 years.
'He's always had a big interest in sports. It really fits his kind of whole M.O.'
Applauding @POTUS Trump for considering a presidential commission on college sports—something I first called for 11 years ago. The conversation is long overdue.👇 https://t.co/7W7ZyFdpFE https://t.co/EsKuyM0Ssy
— Tom McMillen (@TomMcMillen611) May 7, 2025
McMillen first called for a presidential commission on college sports more than a decade ago. He said that while there has been some progress toward a bipartisan bill in Congress, with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) leading the efforts, presidential leadership could help prioritize the issue for Congress.
'I've always said you're going to need a presidential push to get something done,' said McMillen, who was a star basketball player at Maryland, a longtime NBA player and member of the 1972 Olympic team.
He also recalled how a commission on Olympic Sports that was formed by President Gerald Ford in 1975 led to the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 and substantive reform that boosted the United States' performance in subsequent games.
A commission on college sports could help lead to long-term reform without interrupting what is already in motion, McMillen said.
'Not gonna be overnight, but it could be very, very symbolic and very significant for higher ed and college sports, and for America,' McMillen said.

Dunne graced one of the four covers for the 2025 issue, and she was in a celebratory mood on social media.
""Woke up a 2025 Sports Illustrated cover model!"" the 22-year-old former LSU gymnast wrote on X.
Dunne dazzled in an animal-print bikini by Reina Olga for her cover, which was shot in Bermuda.
The other cover models are Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles, accomplished actress Salma Hayek and entrepreneur Lauren Chan.
Dunne also shared the cover on her Instagram story, captioning the post, ""I'm a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover girl!""
Dunne has been featured in the previous two Sports Illustrated Swimsuit editions, and she's excited to see herself on the cover for the first time.
She has appeared alongside other swimsuit models in New York this week to promote the new edition, which included a stop at Citi Field for the New York Mets-Pittsburgh Pirates game.
Dunne is the girlfriend of Pirates star pitcher Paul Skenes, who got the start on Monday night in Queens. He went six innings, allowing one earned run on six hits and three walks, while striking out six batters. The Pirates fell to the Mets, 4-3.
Before the game, swimsuit models Camille Kostek, Ellie Thumann and Xandra Pohl all threw ceremonial first pitches. Dunne decided not to participate.
Dunne recently wrapped up her LSU Tigers gymnastics career after the program failed to repeat as a national champion late last month.
The New Jersey native posted a montage of images from her gymnastics career, from the time she was a toddler in leotards to the moment she became a national champion.
""'Time flies when you're having fun.' Something said that when you're enjoying yourself to the point time seems to slip away from you. That's exactly how the past 20 years in this sport have felt,"" Dunne said in the video. ""The highs, the lows, making the USA national team and competing for our country. Every risk was worth the reward. Finishing my career over the past five years at the best university in the world has been an incredible journey, and I'm forever grateful.
""Gymnastics, you have filled my heart and will always be a part of me. You shaped me into the person I am today, creating memories and sisterhoods that will last a lifetime beyond the sport. You were my first love.""

A settlement in the case of House v. NCAA would allow all Division I schools to share revenue directly with student athletes if it receives final approval this month.
The current system of NIL compensation, in effect since summer 2021, has faced its share of scrutiny. But universities paying athletes directly would all but erase the ""amateurism"" that historically defined American college sports.

Former NFL and college football player Jack Brewer is heavily opposed to the concept.
""We need to get back to student-athletes,"" Brewer told Fox News Digital.
""If a person wants the freedom to make as much money as they want and can leverage the sport to do that, they should absolutely be able to — and they can, in our professional leagues. But there's no place for an unlimited amount of money to be paid to people in college sports. They should be student-athletes, which is what they signed up to be.""

Brewer argued that revenue sharing would worsen a problem created by NIL since its 2021 legalization — declining graduation rates.
""You'll continue to see students who are no longer focused on school because their incentive for going to college is no longer to get an education, but to make money,"" Brewer said.

The bill passed, 32-18, with five Democrats crossing party lines to join with all 27 Republicans in voting ""yes."" The vote marked the second time the GOP-controlled Senate has passed it. An earlier attempt, in concert with a Republican-controlled House, met then-Gov. Tom Wolf's veto pen in 2022.
This time, Senate Republicans are advancing the effort after President Donald Trump declared his intent to ""keep men out of women's sports."" and made it a major campaign issue in last year's election, dividing Democrats on how to respond.
The bill applies to participation in girls' and women's sports that are sponsored by public schools, public universities and publicly chartered community colleges.
It also prohibits any sort of government agency or athletic association from investigating or punishing a school or higher education institution for maintaining separate sports teams for girls or women.
For well over an hour, Republicans and Democrats debated the bill, at times hotly. The sponsor, Sen. Judy Ward, a Republican from Blair County, said the bill would ""ensure all young women have a fair chance to compete in the sports they love.""
Ward said that since 2020 in Pennsylvania, 37 female athletes have lost first place and another 13 lost second or third place, although she didn't say from where she drew the statistics. Pennsylvania's governing body for high school sports, the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association, said it was aware of just one transgender student currently participating in sports.
Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, a Democrat from Allegheny County, called the bill discriminatory against transgender people, as well as ""unnecessary, unwarranted and unconstitutional in my mind.""
Democrats warned that the bill will go nowhere in the House, and a spokesperson for House Democratic leaders accused Senate Republicans of being ""more focused on divisive political theater and bullying kids for political points.""
Gov. Josh Shapiro's office did not respond to an inquiry Tuesday about the bill, although the Democrat has in the past expressed opposition to such bans, calling 2022's bill ""nothing more than cruel, designed to discriminate against transgender youth who just want to play sports like their peers.""
Trump, as president, signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.
In February, the PIAA changed its policy in a move that some officials said was designed to follow Trump's order, except that lawyers on both sides of the issue say the change in policy wording does nothing of the sort.
Previously, the PIAA's policy had deferred to school principals to determine an athlete's ""gender"" when ""questioned or uncertain."" It changed the policy to defer to principals to determine a student's ""sex"" when ""questioned or uncertain,"" and added a line that says that, in accordance with Trump's executive order, ""schools are required to consult with their school solicitors relative to compliance with the order.""
In response to Trump's order, the NCAA revised its transgender participation policy to limit women's college sports to athletes assigned as female at birth. The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, a governing body for smaller schools, effectively banned transgender athletes in 2023 from women's sports.",n/a

The new service, which is set for launch this fall, will provide access to ESPN networks, including professional and college football and basketball games.
""We are providing everything ESPN has to offer directly to fans and all in one place,"" ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said.
Media companies, including Paramount Global (PARA.O), opens new tab, Comcast (CMCSA.O), opens new tab and Disney, are doubling down on sports content to curb subscriber churn, boost engagement and bolster their ad-supported tiers in a competitive market.
The announcement comes a day after Fox Corp (FOXA.O), opens new tab said its new subscription-based streaming service would be called ""Fox One"" and was set to launch before the fall American football season.
Disney said subscribers would be given an option to bundle ESPN with Disney+ and Hulu streaming services at $35.99 per month, with a promotional monthly price of $29.99 for the first year.
The upcoming ESPN streaming service could be a bargain for people who still subscribe to ""$100 cable- or internet-delivered live TV"" packages to access ESPN channels, said Paul Verna, vice president of content at Emarketer.
""ESPN won't offer anything close to the full suite of sports programming that most live TV packages provide, so true sports fans might feel torn between signing up for the new service or sticking with broader pay TV bundles,"" he added.
In 2024, Disney's ESPN, Comcast-owned NBCUniversal and Amazon (AMZN.O), opens new tab clinched the rights to carry National Basketball Association games in an 11-year deal valued at $77 billion. Such deals underscore the value of live sports in attracting new subscribers and advertisers.
Disney, Fox and Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O), opens new tab earlier this year abandoned plans to launch their live sports joint venture Venu Sports after it ran into substantial legal opposition. It was meant to attract sports fans who either canceled or never subscribed to cable TV.",n/a

ESPN announced the show's cancellation in March, and its last show will be on May 23. So, on Thursday's episode, they brought back Jemele Hill, who anchored SportsCenter for a time before she was canned in 2018.
Hill was let go from the network due to social media posts about President Donald Trump and his supporters during his first presidency.
During the episode, host Tony Reali and the other panelists had a segment where they reacted to old takes from her, and Hill could not help but laugh at herself.
""I got a little bit nervous when I saw you were pulling up our tweets. Dude, I just came back, man!"" she said.
The episode also featured the return of Kate Fagan, who left the network in 2018. Fagan made a plea for ""trans kids"" in sports.
""I know it's my last time on [the show], and I want to say something worthy of that platform, and that's trans kids deserve to play sports,"" she said. ""Think about what you remember from your time playing sports. Ninety-nine percent of it is finding that jersey for the first time, your favorite number, community, joy, those high-fives.
""It's that moment when you have a great play with a teammate. It's the feeling of belonging. And it does not know gender. Trans kids deserve the same as everyone else does… Sports is joy. Sports is humanity. And the more people who have that, the better.""
There is no law or order that bans transgender children from participating in sports. Trump signed an executive order in February that prohibits biological males identifying as girls or women from competing against biological females.
Shortly after it was announced the show was ending, former panelist Jay Mariotti, who was a regular on the show until a domestic violence arrest in 2010, said in an interview the show is being canceled because it went ""woke.""

That includes Kate Fagan, who appeared for the last time on the show Thursday. Fagan, a longtime writer and reporter, also played college basketball at Colorado.
Fagan has made appearances on the show since she was first hired by ESPN in 2012. She left the network in 2018 but has continued to appear on the program.
Fagan was determined to be the ""winner"" of Thursday's show against Jemele Hill, who made a return to the show since leaving the network in 2018. The winner of the episode typically delivers a short monologue, and Fagan said ""being on this show has been a privilege and a platform.""

The Portuguese capital pair started the match level on points but Sporting, with the advantage due to their head-to-head record, edged closer to a 21st league title when Francisco Trincao fired them into the lead after four minutes.
Benfica equalised in the 63rd through Kerem Akturkoglu's tap-in from close range after Vangelis Pavlidis sliced through Sporting's defence with a dazzling solo run, bringing the home crowd at the Estadio da Luz back to life.
Sporting remain in pole position and will clinch the title by at least matching Benfica's result on the final day. They host Vitoria Guimaraes while Benfica visit Sporting Braga in what will be a dramatic conclusion to the season next Saturday.",n/a
climate,The Government to Stop Tracking the Costs of Extreme Weather,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/climate/08cli-NOAA-DISASTERS/08cli-NOAA-DISASTERS-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/climate/noaa-billion-dollar-disasters.html,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on Thursday it would stop tracking the cost of the country's most expensive disasters, those which cause at least $1 billion in damage.
The move would leave insurance companies, researchers and government policymakers without information to help understand the patterns of major disasters like hurricanes, drought or wildfires, and their economic consequences, starting this year.Those events are becoming more frequent or severe as the planet grows hotter, although not all disasters are linked to climate change.
It's the latest effort from the Trump administration to restrict or eliminate climate research. In recent weeks the administration has dismissed the authors working on the nation's biggest climate assessment, planned to eliminate National Parks grants focused on climate change, and released a budget plan that would cut significantly climate science from the U.S. Geological Survey and the Energy and Defense departments.
Researchers and lawmakers criticized Thursday's decision.
Jesse M. Keenan, associate professor and director of the Center on Climate Change and Urbanism at Tulane University in New Orleans, said ending the data collection would cripple efforts by federal and state governments to set budgets or make decisions on investment in infrastructure.
'It defies logic,' he said. Without the database, 'the U.S. government's flying blind as to the cost of extreme weather and climate change.'
Few institutions can duplicate the kind of information provided by the database, said Virginia Iglesias, a climate researcher at the University of Colorado. 'It's one of the most consistent and trusted records of climate-related economic loss in the country,' she said. 'The power of the database lies in its credibility.'
So-called billion-dollar disasters — those with costs that balloon to seven figures are more — have been increasing over time. In the 1980s, when NOAA began compiling these lists, there were just over three per year, on average, when adjusted for inflation. For the period from 2020 to 2024, the average was 23 per year.
In total, at least 403 such events have occurred in the United States since 1980. Last year there were 27, a tally second only to 2023 (which had 28).
Last year's disasters included hurricanes Helene and Milton, which together caused about $113 billion in damages and more than 250 deaths, a severe hailstorm in Colorado that caused about $3 billion in damages and a yearlong drought across much of the country that caused $5 billion in damages and claimed the lives of more than 100 people from heat exposure.
NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information plans to stop tracking these billion-dollar disasters in response to 'evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes,' the agency said in an email.
When asked, the agency did not say whether another branch of NOAA or federal agency would continue tracking and publicly reporting the price tag of such disasters. The announcement said the agency would make archived data from 1980 to 2024 available. But the dollar amount of disasters from 2025 on, such as the Los Angeles wildfires and their estimated billions of dollars of damage, would not be tracked and reported to the public.
'You can't fix what you don't measure,' said Erin Sikorsky, the director of The Center for Climate and Security. 'If we lose this information about the costs of these disasters, the American people and Congress won't know what risks climate is posting to our country.'
Other institutions or agencies would likely be unable to duplicate the data collection because it includes proprietary insurance information that companies are cautious to share, Ms. Sikorsky said. 'It's a pretty unique contribution.'",n/a

Trump Says Zero.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/10/multimedia/10cli-cost-of-carbon-fbqz/10cli-cost-of-carbon-fbqz-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/10/climate/social-cost-carbon-trump.html,"The White House has ordered federal agencies to stop considering the economic damage caused by climate change when writing regulations, except in cases where it is 'plainly required' by law.
The directive effectively shelves a powerful tool that has been used for more than two decades by the federal government to weigh the costs and benefits of a particular policy or regulation.
The Biden administration had used the tool to strengthen limits on greenhouse gas emissions from cars, power plants, factories and oil refineries.
Known as the 'social cost of carbon,' the metric reflects the estimated damage from global warming, including wildfires, floods and droughts. It affixes a cost to the economy from one ton of carbon dioxide pollution, the main greenhouse gas that is heating the planet.
When considering a regulation or policy to limit carbon pollution, policymakers have weighed the cost to an industry of meeting that requirement against the economic impact of that pollution on society.
During the Obama administration, White House economists calculated the social cost of carbon at $42 a ton. The first Trump administration lowered it to less than $5 a ton. Under the Biden administration, the cost was adjusted for inflation and jumped to $190 per ton.
But 'it is no longer federal government policy to maintain a uniform estimate of the monetized impacts of greenhouse gas emissions,' Jeffrey B. Clark, the acting administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, wrote in a May 5 memo.
In his memo, Mr. Clark doubted the scientific consensus that pollution from things like transportation and industry is heating the planet.
He argued that there were too many 'uncertainties' in calculating the figure, including 'whether and to what degree any supposed changes in the climate are actually occurring as a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.'
Scientists and environmental groups say that the Trump administration is denying reality.
'It's very clear that climate change is causing harms to people in the United States and around the world, and that these harms are growing worse with increasing warming,' said Robert E. Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University. 'By effectively saying the social cost of carbon should be treated as zero, this policy arbitrarily and capriciously ignores the science and economics of climate change.'
Michael Greenstone, an economist at the University of Chicago who first came up with the idea of the social cost of carbon as a justification for climate policy, said the new guidance means 'feelings, not facts' would guide federal policy.
'The decision is like Alice in Wonderland's Humpty Dumpty, who said 'Words can mean whatever I choose them to mean,'' Mr. Greenstone said. 'So, yes, it is possible to have policies that assume climate change will have no impacts, but that does not make it so.'
The American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies on behalf of the oil and gas industry, has called to 'limit the application of the social cost of carbon' to only the construction phase of certain oil and gas projects. Republican attorneys general have fought the social cost of carbon and described it as an assault on industry.
That's because when the metric is used, the economic benefits of, say, reducing emissions from cars or power plants, rises drastically. The higher the estimate of benefits, the greater the government's justification for compelling the industries to cut back on pollution.
'This number means that the government has a weapon that it can use to justify anything it wants to do,' Elizabeth Murrill, then the solicitor general of Louisiana, said in 2023 as the Biden administration ramped up its cost estimate.
Richard L. Revesz, a climate law expert who served as the regulatory chief in the Biden administration, said the new policy would make it easier for the Trump administration to roll back climate regulations.
It remains unclear whether environmental groups will sue the administration for not considering the social cost of carbon. But analysts said the approval of projects, like pipelines or power plants, would most likely face legal challenges on the grounds that the administration was failing to take climate change into account.",n/a

City leaders are calling that April 29 storm a wake-up call.
""I don't want to be in a situation where we're not prepared. This climate change is real, and we have to make sure that we're climate resilient in every aspect of what we do,"" Gainey said.
Jamil Bey is the director of city planning.
""[It's] a vivid, and painful example of what climate change looks like when it reaches our doorsteps,"" Bey said.
Pittsburgh families were left without electricity for more than a week, some imprisoned in their homes by downed trees and power lines, and the clean-up is still ongoing.
Leaders said next time could be that much worse. It's why Gainey revealed the city's first 'All-Hazard Mitigation Plan,' made up of five key principles, from comprehensive risk assessment, using science and data, to climate resilience.
""Our plan will incorporate future climate scenarios and adaptation strategies to safeguard our people and our infrastructure,"" Gainey said.
It will also include integrative planning with the city's goals around sustainability and housing, and will take social equity into consideration, as the most vulnerable are often the hardest hit.
Lastly, it will be constructed with input from the public. They'll play a primary role as Pittsburgh Fire Chief and Emergency Management Coordinator Darryl Jones leads the effort with Bey, collaborating with partners at the local, state, and federal levels, along with utility companies and experts.
It will start with a 90-day review, looking into what they did well last week and what they need to improve, and how.
""What would we do differently in a city that is populated, you know, to sort of secure those things? What are other cities doing? What are some best practices?"" Bey said.
Jones said the process won't necessarily be easy.
""They're going to be like, I can't feed my kids today, and you want me to put food away for something that might happen,"" Jones said.
It will be a work in progress, but one they said they're not going to wait to execute.
""We have to make sure that the people are taken care of,"" Jones said.
Next week, the city will be having a webinar as they review their storm response, which you can take part in. It will be on May 15 from 2 to 3:30 p.m.

climate,"To keep millions alive after aid cuts, pull climate and other funding in richer nations, group says",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FULZFIBM6YI7BJZEHPEHTSPYIM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/09/trump-humanitarian-aid-cuts-miliband/2f7f9aa6-2cf6-11f0-a724-3bc879c9f843_story.html,"WASHINGTON — As the world's humanitarian organizations are triaging their shrinking amount of funding , the head of the International Rescue Committee stresses that the choice is stark: Keeping millions alive in the most vulnerable countries will require pulling some assistance for programs in better-off countries that target everything from climate change to refugee resettlement.
Life-saving food, water and health programs already are shutting down in countries including Sudan, where the closing of 80% of communal kitchens has ended the only access to food for millions . That comes after the Trump administration dissolved the lead U.S. aid agency and terminated thousands of foreign assistance programs .
'There are lives on the line,' David Miliband, president of the IRC, told The Associated Press in an interview this week in Washington, where he also was speaking to lawmakers and Trump administration officials.
'Our point is there's no way you can keep the aid system as it was,' said Miliband, a former U.K. foreign secretary. As it was, he notes, only 14% of total aid was going to humanitarian efforts , while middle-income countries got more funding than low-income ones.
The triage underway shows the impact of the Trump administration decision to pull the U.S. back from being the world's single largest aid donor . The United States previously provided about a third of the more than $200 billion in foreign assistance given annually by governments worldwide. The White House last week proposed a budget for next year with an 84% cut to such funding.
Other important European donors, including Britain, say they also are cutting aid as they work to free up more money for defense spending, fearing U.S. changes in European defense commitments .
Miliband and his International Rescue Committee are more explicit than some aid groups in offering their ideas for change in leaner funding times. Countries that are doing OK or are downright wealthy should have some of their donor funding redirected, so it can go to the range of needs of poor countries most affected by war and climate change.
'If you're looking for a guideline, I would say at least half the global aid budget needs to go to conflict states,' Miliband said. That's up from about a quarter of total aid now.
Miliband points to climate mitigation in wealthier countries and help for newly arrived refugees to settle in wealthier countries as programs that should be lower priorities for donors in the current harsh aid environment.
With the dust settling from the Trump cuts , aid organizations are looking at how to reorganize to focus on the most vital and strategic aid, said Kate Phillips-Barrasso, a vice president of Mercy Corps, another top humanitarian organization.
'My fear is that we're going to end up in a world' where donors split their efforts between two poles: arranging financing for infrastructure and economic development in middle-income countries or paying for only the most basic aid 'helping people not die' in poor countries, Phillips-Barrasso said.
'I worry about pretty much everything in the middle disappearing,' she said. That would leave the very poorest and most fragile countries never getting the help they need to get ahead of climate change and other threats.
For Miliband and the IRC, donors should focus on getting humanitarian aid, climate help and other vital assistance to 13 poor countries struggling the most with conflicts and environmental damage. That includes Afghanistan, where the Trump administration has cut aid on the grounds that it could benefit the Taliban, and Yemen, where the U.S. recently reached a ceasefire with Houthi militants , who have been targeting global shipping.
The other countries that the IRC identifies as priorities for the shrinking pool of aid funding are Haiti, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Chad, Mali, Mozambique, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan.
The Trump administration's cuts already have forced top aid organizations to pull out of entire countries. Groups say that endangers the progress many countries in Africa and elsewhere have made and threatens further destabilization and extremist gains in volatile regions, including the southern edge of the Sahara.",n/a

The Colorado Supreme Court in a 5-2 decision, opens new tab said federal law did not block Boulder and its surrounding county from claiming that the energy companies violated state law by misleading the public about the dangers associated with fossil fuels.
The ruling marked only the second time a state supreme court has allowed one of the numerous lawsuits by state and local governments against major energy companies over climate change to move forward in the years-long litigation.
The Hawaii Supreme Court allowed a similar lawsuit by Honolulu to move forward against Exxon, Sunoco and several other companies in a decision that the U.S. Supreme Court in January declined to review.
""This ruling affirms what we've known all along: corporations cannot mislead the public and avoid accountability for the damages they have caused,"" Boulder Mayor Aaron Brockett said in a statement.
Exxon in a statement said it would continue to fight Boulder's claims. ""We've maintained from the beginning this case is meritless and has no place before a state court,"" the company said.
Suncor did not respond to a request for comment.
Boulder sued in 2018, alleging the companies violated various state laws and created a public and private nuisance by misleading the public about the role their fossil fuel products played in exacerbating climate change.
Boulder argues they should be forced to pay for the costs it will incur to protect its community from climate change.
The companies deny wrongdoing. They had fought for years to have the case heard in federal court. State courts are often considered a more favorable venue for plaintiffs.
But following years of litigation and two trips to the U.S. Supreme Court, the case ultimately returned to state court, where a trial judge declined to dismiss the lawsuit.
On appeal, the companies argued that Boulder's lawsuit would interfere with the federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act and impair the federal government's ability to conduct foreign affairs.
But Justice Richard Gabriel, who like all of the Colorado Supreme Court's other members was appointed by a Democratic governor, said ""a lawsuit does not amount to regulation merely because it might have an impact on how actors in a given field behave.""
Justice Carlos Samour dissented, expressing concern that Boulder's case sought to effectively regulate interstate air pollution and could lead to ""regulatory chaos.""",n/a

Hello!
After focusing on the myriad environment, social and governance rollbacks in the United States this week, today's newsletter turns its attention to Europe.
This week, the European Parliament gave its backing to soften its EU CO2 emissions targets for cars and vans and reduce potential fines for automakers.
Following heavy lobbying, the European Commission proposed allowing automakers to meet the targets based on their average emissions over the period 2025-2027, rather than just this year.
EU lawmakers voted by 458 votes to 101 in favor of the change. There were 14 abstentions.
European manufacturers had warned that enforcing the targets this year could have resulted in fines of up to 15 billion euros ($17 billion), given the goals rely on selling more electric vehicles – a segment they say is lagging behind Chinese and U.S. rivals.
Critics say the auto industry has had seven years to prepare for the 2025 targets and that the 15 billion euro estimate for fines is vastly inflated.
The European Commission also wants to 'slash red tape' in its energy policies, according to draft conclusions for a summit of EU energy ministers next month seen by Reuters.
The draft conclusions backed the plans to simplify more EU laws, and said this ""is expected to have a profound impact on lowering the regulatory burden for companies in the energy sector and energy intensive industries while maintaining alignment with the original policy objectives.""
The EU's simplification efforts have met mixed reactions so far.
Some industries have backed the plans as a boost to their competitiveness, while large companies said they offered little relief from bureaucracy, and some investors and campaigners criticized the weakening of sustainability rules as a blow to Europe's efforts to curb climate change.

The decision, opens new tab by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was a win for the schools in a long-running dispute over CRISPR patent rights with the Broad Institute, a joint venture of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The U.S. Patent Office had previously determined that Broad Institute scientists conceived the technology before Doudna and Charpentier.
The Federal Circuit on Monday said that the office had misapplied federal law on patent conception and sent the case back to the Patent Office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board for reconsideration.
A Broad Institute spokesperson said the institute was confident that the board will ""again confirm Broad's patents, because the underlying facts have not changed.""
Spokespeople and an attorney for the University of California and the University of Vienna did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
CRISPR enables scientists to use biological ""scissors"" to edit DNA. The technology is being tested in clinical trials to help cure diseases caused by genetic mutations and abnormalities.
The University of California's Doudna and Charpentier of the University of Vienna were first to seek a CRISPR patent in 2012. They shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their CRISPR work eight years later.
The Broad Institute applied for its own patent covering the use of CRISPR in ""eukaryotic"" plant or animal cells in 2013 and received the patent in 2014. Doudna, Charpentier and their universities challenged the institute at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, arguing they came up with the same invention first.
The board determined in 2022 that the Broad Institute was entitled to the patent rights, finding that the challengers had not created CRISPR technology that works with eukaryotic cells before the institute invented it.
The universities argued in the appeal that their teams ""conceived of and described every element of the invention before the Broad Institute's first alleged conception.""
The Federal Circuit ruled for the Broad Institute in a related case in 2018.
The case is Regents of the University of California v. Broad Institute, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 22-1653.

Late Wednesday evening, Douglas County Sheriff's deputies pursued a stolen vehicle that ended with a crash at Centennial Airport. The incident is one of many examples of law enforcement across the state catching suspects with the help of Flock cameras, which take photos of license plates that drive by.
Douglas County Sheriff's Office
However, on Monday, the Denver City Council unanimously rejected a two-year extension of the Flock Safety Program, which placed license plate readers along roadways all across Denver. Members cited privacy concerns and potential opportunities for misuse as reasons.
To Douglas County Sheriff Darren Weekly, it should only be concerning for those breaking the law.
""I had the system up yesterday, about every five or 10 minutes, I had an alert that we had a problem,"" said Weekly.
CBS
The Sheriff calls the technology a game changer and is concerned with Denver's recent decision not to renew its contract to keep it.
""For Denver to stop using this technology, they are potentially affecting the entire rest of the Denver Metro area and our ability to solve crimes in our jurisdiction,"" said Weekly. ""It's a black hole for law enforcement. ""
Jurisdictions across the state are able to access the database to catch suspects wanted for crimes.
""Criminals talk. Not only do they talk about where law enforcement is going to chase you or be more aggressive in terms of our ability to capture you. But they also talk about who has license plate readers and who doesn't have license plate readers. They plan for that.""
Through this technology, law enforcement is alerted when a vehicle associated with a crime passes by a Flock camera. It uploads a photo of the vehicle and its license plate, as well as a pin on a map of where it was located.
CBS
The deputy who receives the alert would then have to access an additional state computer database to gain more information, such as who the vehicle is registered to.
""Nobody is accessing this information without a need to know. They need to have a case number or articulate their reasons for accessing the information, but again, they have to look at another database to determine what they actually have. That information is not available on the system itself,"" said Weekly.
In addition to general privacy concerns, Denver city council members fear the information could be shared with ICE. But, both the Denver Police Department and Sheriff Weekly say that's not happening.
""We have never given ICE any information, and they have never asked for it,"" Weekly explained. ""There's absolutely no facial recognition that is associated with this. This just searches plates and vehicle descriptions. That's it.""
A Denver city council member told CBS Colorado the city council is now working on an ordinance that will govern surveillance technology. The belief is that the mayor's office would like to continue using this type of technology, only under the protection of an ordinance.",n/a

The hearing comes as the race to control the future of artificial intelligence is heating up between companies and countries. Altman's OpenAI is in a furious race to develop the best artificial intelligence model against tech rivals like Alphabet and Meta, as well as against those developed by Chinese competitors.
'I believe this will be at least as big as the internet, maybe bigger,' Altman said in his opening remarks about AI's potential to transform society. 'For that to happen, investment in infrastructure is critical.' Altman urged senators to help usher in the 'dual revolutions' of artificial intelligence and energy production that 'will change the world we live in, I think, in incredibly positive ways.'
The witnesses included Altman; Lisa Su, chief executive of semiconductor maker AMD; Michael Intrator, co-founder of AI cloud computing startup CoreWeave; and Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft. They four executives unanimously urged lawmakers to help streamline policy for AI-related projects and fundraising.
The hearing spanned topics ranging from industry debates over chip performance, jobs, human relationships and power generation to grander questions about the global competition with China and the European Union.
'China aims to lead the world in AI by 2030,' said Sen. Ted Cruz, chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. 'In this race, the United States is facing a fork in the road. Do we go down the path that embraces our history of entrepreneurial freedom and technological innovation? Or do we adopt the command and control policies of Europe?'
Senators were broadly sober in their questioning and united in their concern that the U.S. maintain its dominance in artificial intelligence. Lawmakers from both parties also raised concerns over cybersecurity, data privacy and AI's ability to create content that could confuse or mislead people.
Some partisan fighting did arise. Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, pressed Su and Smith on whether the Biden administration's sustainable energy policies hindered the goal of producing more power for AI-related infrastructure.
And Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, criticized cuts by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to federal funding for research and to agencies like the Energy Department's national laboratories and National Science Foundation, painting them as 'a self sabotaging attack.'
'Does anyone truly have confidence that had DOGE been around decades ago, they would not have cut the project that created the internet as an example of wasteful, publicly funded research and development?' asked Duckworth.
But despite some barbs, the hearing maintained a low-key tenor and some bipartisan joking as lawmakers and executives discussed the potential of a technology all present agreed would determine humanity's future.
'Look, there is a race, but we need to understand what we're racing for,' Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, told the witnesses. 'It's not just a sort of commercial race, so we can edge out our nearest competitor in the public sector or the private sector. We're trying to win a race so that American values prevail.'
Several of the executives warned against U.S. export controls that could end up pushing other countries toward China's AI technology.
'We totally understand as an industry the importance of national security,' Su said. But she added, if not able to 'have our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play.' Those technologies are less advanced today but will mature over time, she said.
Altman drew a direct connection between the United State's ability to attract global talent and ability to sell its products globally to national security and its international influence.
'The leverage and the power the U.S. gets from having iPhones be the mobile device people most want, and Google being the search engine that people most want around the world is huge,' Altman said. 'We talk maybe less about how much people want to use chips and other infrastructure developed here, but I think it's no less important, and we should aim to have the entire U.S. stack be adopted by as much of the world as possible.'
Trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the AI industry, including California-based chipmakers Nvidia and AMD.
The Trump administration announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 chips and AMD's MI308 chips to China.
Nvidia has said the tighter export controls will cost the company an extra $5.5 billion. AMD said after reporting its quarterly earnings this week that it will cost the firm $1.5 billion in lost revenue over the coming months.
Still uncertain are the effects on additional AI chip controls set by former President Joe Biden's administration that are set to take effect next week targeting more than 100 countries. The policy drew strong opposition from Nvidia and other tech companies, while it was supported by others, including AI company Anthropic, as a way to prevent China's 'sophisticated smuggling operations' to obtain chips from shell companies in third countries.
The Commerce Department said in an email Thursday that Trump plans to replace Biden's 'overly complex, overly bureaucratic' rule with a simpler one but didn't say when.
The day before the hearing, Altman visited the Abilene, Texas, site of the massive Stargate data center project being built for OpenAI in collaboration with Oracle and other partners. The site was chosen for its potential access to a variety of energy resources, including wind and solar power.
Altman, during the hearing, said that Texas had been 'unbelievable' in incentivizing major AI projects. 'I think that would be a good thing for other states to study,' Altman said. He predicted that the Abilene site would be the 'largest AI training facility in the world.'
But Altman also later cautioned against a patchwork regulatory framework for AI.
'It is very difficult to imagine us figuring out how to comply with 50 different sets of regulations,' said Altman. 'One federal framework that is light touch, that we can understand, and it lets us move with the speed that this moment calls for, seems important and fine.'
While the tech industry has long relied on data centers to run online services, from email and social media to financial transactions, new AI technology behind popular chatbots and generative AI tools requires even more powerful computation to build and operate .
A report released by the Department of Energy late last year estimated that the electricity needed for data centers in the U.S. tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple again by 2028 when it could consume up to 12% of the nation's electricity.

technology,UNITED CEO SCOTT KIRBY: Newark Liberty Airport needs action now,https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/07/Boeing-max.jpg,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/united-ceo-scott-kirby-newark-liberty-airport-needs-action-now,"The weeks of continued disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) has put America's Air Traffic Control System in the spotlight and has revealed a broken system. Decades of failing to properly invest in the system has prevented good-faith efforts to make technology upgrades and bolster the staffing of our nation's hard-working air traffic controllers.
But don't conflate these challenges and constraints with safety. The truth is that all the flights in and out of EWR are absolutely safe. When there are FAA issues -- technology outages, staffing shortages, etc. -- the FAA requires all airlines to slow down aircraft and/or cancel flights to maintain the highest levels of safety.
At United, we do our part to maintain safety as well by ensuring our pilots have thousands of hours of flight experience and supplement that with regular simulator training – we also have procedures that our pilots follow to re-establish communication if controllers lose radio contact to navigate the airplane safely to its destination.
In short, neither the FAA nor United will ever compromise on safety.
But when the FAA has technology outages or staffing shortages, it leads to delays and cancellations for our customers and that's the issue we're determined to solve.
The good news is that we are on the verge of solving this persistent customer delay problem at EWR. All that's left is the FAA using the authority -- that only they have -- to designate EWR as a Level 3 airport.
President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have introduced a plan to fund and execute a long-term modernization of our antiquated system. And while that is a huge step forward, it will also take time -- there are no short-cuts to overhaul a technology system this vast, complex and critical to our economic and national security.
Immediately returning Newark to a Level 3 slot-controlled airport is the most effective way to provide relief to air traffic controllers and deliver a better experience for customers.
EWR is a crown jewel of the region and an international gateway for the U.S.– close to 50 million people flew through EWR last year – but the truth is there are more flights scheduled there than the FAA can handle.
Every other large capacity constrained airport uses slots to make sure that the number of scheduled flights in any given hour does not exceed the airport's maximum capacity. And EWR is the only large airport in the world that no longer has this basic common-sense rule (in 2016, the FAA de-slotted EWR).
Even worse, when you look at customer impact data at EWR before 2017 when the airport was slotted and compare it to the years just before and after the pandemic (2017-2019 and 2022-2025), the numbers are *worse* at a de-slotted EWR:
Newark's air traffic controllers do impressive work with professionalism and a deep focus on safety, while operating some of the most complex airspace in the world. But they manage it with technology developed during World War II and with staffing levels far below what is needed to operate at full capacity.
And again, the president and secretary's plan to modernize the ATC system and get EWR ATC fully staffed is a giant leap in the right direction.
But to make an impact at EWR that will be felt today, the FAA must also return EWR to a Level 3 slot controlled airport.
It was a mistake to de-slot the airport in 2016 -- every single data point says so -– and we know that implementing slots is the immediate action the FAA can take to reduce congestion there now.",n/a

""I believe the most promising technology when it comes to public safety is drones,"" said Arlington Police Chief Al Jones.
The department said it will now use drones to respond to burglaries, aggravated assaults, missing persons calls and so much more. This change comes after receiving more liberty from the FAA.
""Today, I'm proud to announce that the Arlington Police Department is one of the first few agencies in the United States to be granted a beyond line-of-sight waiver from the FAA,"" said Arlington police Sgt. Eric Borton.
Back in 2023, the department began testing its drone program by responding to fireworks calls during the 4th of July and New Year's Eve weekends.
At the time, FAA regulations limited how far drones could fly, but with this change, police can now operate drones from inside the Real Time Crime Center and send them further.
""The aircraft can fly about a mile and a half, which is a lot further than they could see in the past,"" said Borton.
The department has 15 drones and said 40 officers are trained to operate them. Arlington PD also installed two drone docks so officers can instantly launch the device.
""The aircraft can travel up to 35 miles an hour, so in many cases, we are there, the remote pilot in charge is there before the officers get there,"" said Borton.
Jones believes drone technology can keep officers safe when responding to calls by up to 75-95%, ""depending on the information we are able to obtain up in the air.""",n/a

""This is mainly due to the accelerated financing of expenses in January of this year, as well as the decrease in oil and gas revenue inflows, but it will not affect the execution of the target parameters of the structural balance for the year 2025 overall,"" a ministry statement said.
Fiscal expenditure grew by 21% in year-on-year terms in the four months to 15.5 trillion roubles, making up 36.6% of the full year spending plan. Budget revenues for the same period grew by 5%.

Russia's finance ministry raised the 2025 budget deficit estimate to 1.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) on Wednesday from 0.5%, after reducing the energy revenues forecast by 24% due to expectations of a prolonged period of low oil prices.
Increased spending to finance the military operation in Ukraine has kept the budget deficit close to 2% of GDP over the last three years. The accelerated budget spending has also fuelled inflation.

More than 50 people were killed when the youth-led marches broke out last June, forcing President William Ruto to abandon tax hikes worth 346 billion shillings ($2.68 billion), and causing a delay to funding from the International Monetary Fund.
""The finance bill doesn't have to always adjust tax rates upwards,"" John Mbadi, the finance minister, told a televised meeting late on Tuesday.
""The finance bill of this year is more on tax administration and trying to seal the loopholes and also make tax collection efficient.""
The government has sent a finance bill, which is usually the government's vehicle for amending laws to maximise revenue collection, to parliament for passage, part of the process towards the 2025/26 (July-June) budget presentation next month.
It has also sent spending proposals that set the total expenditure at about 4 trillion shillings to parliament for debate and approval, including a budget deficit of 4.5% of GDP.
""There are no new major tax measures,"" Mbadi said, adding that this year's finance bill is targeting extra revenue of 25-30 billion shillings.
Critics have complained about a proposal in the tax bill that, if passed by parliament, will allow the tax authority to access financial information belonging to businesses and individuals, helping it to detect any tax evasion.
Mbadi defended the proposal, saying many wealthy people do not pay their fair share of taxes and hide behind the legal provision that bars authorities from accessing certain data.

NSE's letter to the finance ministry requesting assistance came after its latest application in March to secure a 'no objection certificate (NOC)' from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was not cleared, according to the sources who asked not to be identified because they were not authorised to speak with media.
The exchange, India's largest, had made similar requests in November 2019, twice in 2020, and again in August 2024.
The NSE did not respond to Reuters email and phone queries on Tuesday. However, the exchange on Thursday denied that it is seeking government intervention to resolve the impasse after the story was published earlier in the day.
""NSE has not had any correspondence with government of India in last 30 months relating to its IPO,"" NSE said.
SEBI and the finance ministry did not respond to emailed requests for comment.
""The letter requests the Ministry of Finance to engage with the newly appointed SEBI Chairman to address and resolve the concerns raised by SEBI regarding NSE's pending public offer,"" one source said.
NSE's appeal to the government has not been previously reported.
Tuhin Kanta Pandey, who became SEBI chairman in March, last month had said the regulator was working to resolve issues surrounding NSE's public offer but will not allow commercial interests to take precedence over the general public interest.
""Different departments at SEBI had raised concerns,"" a second source said. ""Until all departments are satisfied that issues have been addressed, an NOC is unlikely to be issued.""
One of the key concerns flagged by SEBI is on governance shortfalls at the exchange, including a delay in appointing a chairman to its board. NSE, in its letter to the finance ministry, dismissed those concerns and blamed SEBI for a delay in approving a candidate it recommended for chairman in 2022.
SEBI had also raised concerns about NSE's process of appointing top management. NSE told the ministry its processes are compliant with SEBI rules, according to the letter.
NSE's letter also questions the regulator's ""neutrality"" in recent decisions which have hurt its business interests more than those of competitor BSE, citing certain SEBI decisions on new rules for the futures and options market.
NSE also questioned a recent SEBI proposal asking exchanges to disinvest their holdings in clearing corporations. This could raise costs and undermine market stability, the exchange told the government in its letter.

The price of Angola's 2030 bond, which serves as collateral for the loan from JPMorgan, fell from 100 cents on the dollar at the end of March to a low of 86 cents during the selloff, before recovering to 95 cents last week, market participants said.
Angola's 2032 bond is trading with a yield of 12.63%, having recovered slightly from last month but still in double-digit territory which points to limited market access.
The margin call came after trade turmoil fuelled concerns over global economic growth and contributed to a slide in the price of crude oil, a key export earner for Angola. This in turn sent the country's international bonds sharply lower.
The government has said its ability to produce the $200 million immediately and in cash was a sign of strength. However, it has also said it would be cautious with lending plans ahead.
""The current situation requires a great deal of thought and, following this vision, we will try to be restrained when taking on new responsibilities,"" the ministry said.",n/a

The long-frozen conflict, dating back to 1975, pits Morocco, which considers the territory as its own, against the Algeria-backed Polisario front, which seeks an independent state called the Sahrawi Republic in Western Sahara.
The investment was announced on Monday following a visit to the Moroccan capital Rabat and to Western Sahara by AFD chief Remy Rioux, who met members of the cabinet and local officials, AFD said in a statement.
The funds will be directed at environmental and water supply projects among other social and economic development programmes, it said.
French President Emmanuel Macron has backed Morocco's sovereignty over the North African territory and supported its autonomy plan as the only solution to the conflict.
He paid a visit to Rabat in October during which deals worth over $10 billion were signed.
France said it will also open a cultural centre and a consular service to process visa applications from the territory.
Relations between France and Algeria worsened after Macron's support for Rabat's position on Western Sahara.
Since 2020, Morocco has won backing from the U.S. and the territory's former colonial power Spain, as well as Israel and more than two dozen African and Arab nations.
The UN Security Council has been calling in recent resolutions on the parties to negotiate a ""political"" and ""mutually acceptable"" solution to the conflict.

India's $4 trillion economy has limited direct trade with Pakistan, and even its overnight cross-border missile strikes had little immediate impact on local equity, currency and bond markets, on the view that full-fledged conflict is unlikely.
""If there is a cessation of hostilities like there should be, pragmatically and practically, the investment climate may not actually be harmed,"" said Ajay Marwaha, head of fixed income at Mumbai-headquartered investment house Nuvama Group.
Previous conflicts have not had a lasting impact on Indian assets, Citibank analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday.
In the last such flare-up with Pakistan, in February 2019, the Indian rupee held steady and bond yields rose 15 basis points over that month but retreated later.
In June 2020, when fighting broke out between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan valley, the rupee weakened 1% but regained ground as the two sides disengaged, Citi analysts said.
Since U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a slate of huge tariffs on his country's trading partners, Indian markets have in fact performed well.
""The Indian market had begun to outperform on the back of the perception that there is some insulation from Trump tariffs given the strength of domestic consumption and a clear signal of monetary loosening from the central bank,"" said Sat Dhura, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors.
He acknowledged that: ""Recent events are likely to keep foreign investors away,"" but added that local investment flows are likely to be sticky, helping serve as a support to the markets.
India is expected to remain the fastest-growing major economy with the central bank forecasting GDP growth of 6.5% this financial year. It is also among the best-performing of the world's big stock markets since early April, when Washington announced reciprocal tariffs on its trading partners, with the benchmark Nifty 50 (.NSEI), opens new tab rising 4.6% since then.
Foreign investors, who had heavily sold Indian stocks from last October to March of this year, turned buyers in April and early May purchasing about $1.5 billion. They remained sellers of Indian bonds, offloading $1.7 billion since the start of April.
UAE-based asset manager NAV Capital reckons that the geopolitical flare-up may temper immediate foreign portfolio flows into India but it expects global investors to remain invested in the country unless the latest conflict spirals.
FOCUS ON TRADE DEALS
The focus, analysts said, remains on trade deals.
India sealed a long-negotiated trade agreement with the U.K. on Tuesday and discussions are ongoing for a bilateral trade agreement with the U.S.
""While sentiments are likely to be jittery in the immediate term, these tensions are unlikely to derail the medium-term appeal of the Indian economy,"" said Radhika Rao, senior economist at DBS Bank in Singapore.
More ""substantial developments"" like the just-concluded India-UK trade deal, the impending agreement with the U.S. and the central bank's dovish policies will dictate the path of India's growth trade outlook, Rao said.
As part of these trade negotiations, India plans to bring down high tariffs for raw materials which have prevented large-scale manufacturing to move to the country.
The impact of the conflict between India and Pakistan on any potential longer-term investment ""may not be very much"", said Subhash Chandra Garg, a former top government bureaucrat.
The areas bordering Pakistan are in the north and west of India but most foreign investment for manufacturing facilities is centred in southern and central India, Garg noted.",n/a
conflicts,The Wars We Still Can Stop,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/09/multimedia/09hudson-zpcg/09hudson-zpcg-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/opinion/international-world/wars-horn-of-africa.html,"Conflict, famine and a great-power competition are colliding in the Horn of Africa, creating enormous instability. The growing prospect of overlapping civil wars and conflicts between nations in the region, which is home to more than 200 million people and accounts for billions of dollars in global commerce, is reason enough for alarm. These conflicts also have the potential to unleash terrorist threats and an increase in migration that could engulf European and Persian Gulf countries, threatening America's far-reaching interests.
America's commitment to helping stabilize the Horn of Africa might have been taken for granted even a few months ago. That does not seem the case anymore. The questions that stand out today are whether the Trump administration has any interest in trying to address the sources of this instability and, if not, what will happen next.
Last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio rolled out a plan for streamlining the State Department that included eliminating the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations, responsible for heading off incipient conflicts and for providing technical expertise in mediation and peace building. President Trump's recently unveiled State Department budget further proposes eliminating U.S. funding for international peacekeeping operations.
The department will reportedly no longer consider acts like the detention of political prisoners and the lack of free and fair elections, two precursors of wider conflict and instability, as part of annual human rights reporting required by Congress. These changes are on top of the gutting of U.S.A.I.D. and the U.S. Institute of Peace, which supported the kinds of conflict prevention that improved U.S. national security interests and our moral standing. Wars in the Horn of Africa will undoubtedly imperil even the administration's more narrowly defined interests of counterterrorism and mineral extraction across the wider region. Red Sea shipping could well be shut down, and terrorist groups would probably proliferate.
Virtually every country in this vital region is at risk of collapse.
Sudan, with some 50 million people and roughly 500 miles of Red Sea coastline, is in the midst of its third year of civil war, which has displaced nearly 13 million people and left double that in need of lifesaving support. It is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world and one of the most underresourced: Just over 10 percent of the funding needed has been allocated this year.
The Trump administration is struggling to maintain the emergency humanitarian assistance that it claims to be committed to. Nor does it seem inclined to appoint a special envoy, which every previous president since Bill Clinton did, including Mr. Trump in his first term. Washington's cuts to humanitarian assistance are already costing lives, making an impossible situation far worse.
Neighboring South Sudan is on the cusp of another civil war, its second in just over a decade. Ethnic militias are being mobilized, and skirmishes have broken out. An attack on a U.N. helicopter in March killed a crew member and two dozen government troops and has put everyone on high alert, triggering the withdrawal of diplomatic staff members from the capital, Juba. The last conflict there cost nearly 400,000 lives — and that was with a U.S.-led global diplomatic response. A similar response seems unlikely to come.
In Ethiopia, with more than 130 million people, American diplomats helped broker a 2022 peace deal, ending a brutal war in the northern Tigray region that killed as many as 600,000 people, by some estimates. Relations in Tigray continue to deteriorate, stoked by neighboring Eritrea, which is looking for ways to stymie Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's ambition of gaining sea access for his landlocked nation.
Eritrea has begun a general mobilization of troops, putting the country on a war footing. Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a border war 25 years ago, and its end was negotiated by American diplomats and overseen by U.N. peacekeepers. But since last year, Washington has not tended to the peace deal it helped bring about and has left empty the position of a special envoy for the Horn of Africa that helped the Biden administration navigate these perilous waters.
The United States is playing an active role only in Somalia, home to the Islamic State's main affiliate in Africa, but that role is limited to drone strikes against terrorist targets. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has stepped up activity, with the U.S. military striking over 20 times in his first 100 days — doubling the attacks under the Biden administration in its last year in office. While these strikes put terrorists on notice, they have done little to address substantial ground gains that the Shabab terrorist group has made.
Washington has grown frustrated that the billions of dollars it has spent over two decades to build state capacity in Mogadishu has produced few solid returns. It seems unlikely that the Trump administration will double down on the political and security support that is still needed. In another sign of cost saving, Washington is planning to significantly downsize or close a number of diplomatic missions in the region, including in Somalia, according to an internal State Department memo, further undercutting hope of being able to manage a regional crisis.
Mr. Trump's national security team knows the U.S. military plays an irreplaceable role in the region. In the Signalgate text messages, Mike Waltz, then the national security adviser, argued that 'European navies do not have the capability to defend against the kinds of sophisticated anti-ship, cruise missiles and drones the Houthis are now using.' He added, 'It will have to be the U.S. that reopens these shipping lanes,' referring to Red Sea routes. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth agreed, writing: 'We are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close.'
Much has been made recently of the administration's near singular focus on restoring the warrior ethos and on America's hard-power strengths, as evidenced by Mr. Trump's trillion dollar defense budget request. But the challenges we face in the Horn of Africa are not solvable by armed drones alone. Gen. James Mattis explained the issue when he warned 10 years ago, 'If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.' Not only is our peacemaking capability no longer fully funded; it is being crushed at the moment it is needed most.
If we don't bring back peacemaking and save what remains of our ability to use development and diplomacy to end wars or, better still, to avoid them, the coming conflicts in the Horn of Africa are certain to teach us painful and costly lessons. States could fail, millions of refugees could suffer and take flight, and malign forces like Russia and Iran could seek advantage in the chaos.
The only question left will be: How many American warriors do we intend to commit to wars we could have stopped before they started?",n/a

conflicts,A Tension Unlike Anything Felt in Decades,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/09/multimedia/09india-pakistan-1971-first-person-fchm/09india-pakistan-1971-first-person-fchm-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/asia/a-tension-unlike-anything-felt-in-decades.html,"As the conflict between India and Pakistan has escalated, with its impact felt well beyond the border in the disputed region of Kashmir, this is the tensest time I can remember since 1971.
That was the year of the last major declared war between India and Pakistan. I was in seventh grade, and I can recall the sirens, the blackouts, and drills — much like what has been happening over the past couple of days.
In those days of intense conflict, the main source of information was a couple of radio stations. People would gather around a radio for accounts of the war, like a dogfight between the fighter jets of the two sides in northern India.
This time, the action again has been in the north of India, where the two countries share a border. The escalation has been very rapid. It is clear that a lot of strikes have taken place on both sides, and in unprecedented ways, like the use of drones and missiles to target populated areas.
What is drastically different this time, besides the new weapons, is the flood of disinformation on social media and television screens. It has made the job of reporting extremely hard, and it has added to a sense of panic among people. It is perhaps the most confusing information space I can remember in my three decades of reporting.
The nationalist fervor is the same, even if the expressions of it are very different now.
India was a largely poor country in the 1970s. Villages and schools, including the one I attended, organized local fund-raisers for the army, donating money or bringing food and water, snacks and tea to the roads wherever army convoys would pass through.
India is the world's fifth-largest economy now, and increasingly a technological power. But that also has raised the risks of a wider conflict, as advanced weapons and drones from both sides render borders irrelevant and turn every part of the country into a potential target.",n/a
conflicts,Drones Complicate the Fight Between India and Pakistan,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/09/multimedia/09india-pakistan-drones-kzgb/09india-pakistan-drones-kzgb-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/world/asia/drones-india-pakistan-fighting.html,"The debut of attack drones in the conflict between India and Pakistan injects a new and worrying style of warfare between the two nuclear armed powers, experts said.
But it was also inevitable, given the proliferation of armed drones in combat worldwide.
Both India and Pakistan have been developing their respective drone-building industries in recent years, and both import drones from foreign allies. Most of what is being deployed now amid the latest conflict, after an attack in the disputed Kashmir region, appear to be one-way Kamikaze drones that became ubiquitous in the war in Ukraine and will all but certainly be a standard weapon on battlefields going forward.
India has said it identified Turkish drones used by Pakistan; Pakistan said it identified Israeli drones used by India. Neither of those reports could be independently verified.
Neither country appears to be using any drones capable of carrying nuclear warheads, said James Patton Rogers, a drone warfare expert at Cornell University. And while he called the conflict 'incredibly worrying,' he also noted that drones generally are used as the lowest possible escalatory step in a conflict, usually to pressure and probe an opponent's air defenses.
'I'm cautiously optimistic by the fact that the first response is a limited number of drones used,' Mr. Rogers, the executive director of Cornell's Brooks Tech Policy Institute, said in an interview on Friday. 'They show that, politically and militarily, they can inflict damage when and where they want to, and both sides have been certainly attempting to do that.'
At least 118 countries currently have drones in their arsenals, up from about 60 nations in 2010 that either had or were considering them, Mr. Rogers said.
Pakistan likely has a limited number of drones, he said, although it has developed several attack drones and also so-called loitering munitions, like the kamikaze drones. It also imports armed drones from China and, as recently as last year, from Turkey, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
India's drone industry is far more sophisticated, Mr. Rogers said, and includes ground, air and sea drones. He said it also buys them from Israel.
He said neither side had likely launched more than 100 drones against the other, and warned that misinformation could exaggerate the size of reported attacks.
Shuja Nawaz, the former director at The Atlantic Council's South Asia Center, said both India and Pakistan appeared to be using the drones to scout the positions of each other's weapons systems and test their response times. He said both were refusing to recognize international rules governing sovereign airspace.
'There will be frustration in their ability to do the kind of damage that they want on the other side, through the use of unmanned aerial weapon systems,' Mr. Nawaz said. 'And then the next stage may well be trying to resort to aircraft and missiles. And since both have nuclear weapons, God knows what else.'",n/a
conflicts,"Vance says Russia's demands are too high, but there's still a path to 'durable peace' with Ukraine",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/12/file-96.png,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vance-says-russias-demands-too-high-theres-still-path-durable-peace-ukraine,"WASHINGTON — Vice President JD Vance said that the concessions that Russia is seeking from Ukraine to end the conflict between the two are too stringent, but he believes there is a viable path forward for peace and wants both to find common ground.
""The step that we would like to make right now, is we would like both the Russians and the Ukrainians to actually agree on some basic guidelines for sitting down and talking to one another,"" Vance said here Wednesday at the Munich Leaders Meeting in Washington.
""We think that if cool heads prevail here, we can bring this thing to a durable peace that will be economically beneficial for both Ukrainians and the Russians,"" Vance said.
Vance appeared for a discussion with Ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger, president of the Foundation Council of the Munich Security Conference and the former German ambassador to the U.S.
Russia's demands include Ukraine never joining NATO and preventing foreign peacekeeper troops from deploying to Ukraine following the conflict. Russia is also seeking to adjust some of the borders that previously were Ukraine's.
Additionally, Ukraine is on board with a 30-day ceasefire, while Russia refuses to participate. Vance said that the U.S. is seeking to find solutions beyond the ceasefire.
""We've tried to move beyond the obsession with the 30-day ceasefire, and more on what the long-term settlement look like, and we've tried to consistently advance the ball,"" Vance said.
Vance has urged European nations to bolster defense spending and increase European independence, aligning with the Trump administration's ""America First"" agenda that has pushed NATO allies to beef up their own military spending.
The event comes as Ischinger recently cautioned that any attempts to establish a peacekeeping force in Ukraine to end the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv absent the U.S. could mean the ""de facto end of NATO,"" according to Politico.
Should the U.K. and France send a peacekeeping force there like they have both discussed without U.S. involvement, that could prompt Russia to accuse Ukrainians of starting a conflict, Ischinger said in a Politico interview published Monday.
VANCE'S 'AMERICA FIRST' APPROACH GOES GLOBAL, TAKES HARDLINE MESSAGE TO GREENLAND
""And therefore the Europeans in Ukraine would possibly be shot at, and would need to reply, to engage without the United States on their side,"" Ischinger said. ""Quite frankly, that would be the end of NATO as we know it.""
Vance previously appeared at the Munich Security Council in February, when he laid out the Trump administration's stance that Europe ""step up in a big way to provide for its own defense.""
He also cautioned that Russia and China do not pose as great a threat to European nations as the ""threat from within,"" in regard to issues like censorship and illegal immigration.
European leaders pushed back on the remarks at the time, with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius saying he perceived the comments as a comparison to ""conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regimes.""

People in the area said it's generally quiet, at least compared to what it was years ago, but now, the city is hoping the Santa Monica Entertainment Zone will attract crowds.
""If we want to bring our tourists and regional visitors back downtown, I think we need to make it worth their while,"" said Caroline Torosis, the Santa Monica Mayor Pro Tem.
On Tuesday night, the Santa Monica City Council approved the designation of Santa Monica's Entertainment Zone to allow adults over the age of 21 to purchase an alcoholic drink from licensed and participating businesses and consume it outdoors.
Some residents said Santa Monica has fallen on hard times, especially since the pandemic, with the sight of more officers and crime scenes as well as a lack of big crowds in popular areas. But they think this new idea can bring the area back.

The planned Disney waterfront resort will be located on Yas Island, a popular tourist destination that is home to other family-friendly attractions, including Warner Bros World Yas Island, SeaWorld Yas Island and Yas Waterworld Abu Dhabi.
The city of Abu Dhabi has a population of about 2.5 million, but Yas Island recorded more than 34 million visits in 2023, a 38% rise compared to the year before, Miral has said.
'We've always been interested in this part of the world - to bring our Disney stories to new, younger fans,' Disney's Experiences unit Chairman Josh D'Amaro told Reuters, adding, 'Abu Dhabi was an ideal location for us.'
Miral, the Abu Dhabi-based leisure and entertainment group responsible for developing Yas Island, will finance, build and operate the resort. The creative and technical professionals who design Disney's theme parks, known as Imagineers, will lead creative design and provide operational oversight.
The U.S. entertainment company will earn royalties based on the park's revenue, according to a regulatory filing.
The Disney park ""will be authentically Disney and distinctly Emirati - an oasis of extraordinary Disney entertainment that is at the crossroads of the world,' Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a statement on Wednesday.
Abu Dhabi is known for its oil wealth, though last year it announced plans to invest more than $10 billion in infrastructure to grow its tourism business. The international airport in UAE's commercial hub Dubai aims to boost its capacity to accommodate 120 million passengers a year by 2026.
Disney did not announce the opening date for the new park, though D'Amaro said a project of this scale could take a year or two to design, and another four to six years to build.
Once complete, the resort will offer Disney-themed attractions, dining and retail experiences, in a way that blends the Burbank entertainment company's storytelling and Abu Dhabi's heritage, D'Amaro said.
INVESTMENTS IN EXPERIENCES UNIT
The Abu Dhabi park, Disney's first since Shanghai Disneyland opened in 2016, represents a continuation of the company's plans to 'turbocharge' its Experiences unit, which includes its six global theme park resorts, a cruise ship line and a family resort in Hawaii.
In 2023, Disney announced it would commit $60 billion over a decade to double the size of its Disney cruise ship fleet and invest in its theme parks. It also took a minority stake in Epic Games, creator of the online game Fortnite.
Miral initially approached Disney to talk about their plans for creating a tourism hub in Abu Dhabi, said D'Amaro. That conversation led Disney executives to visit the prospective theme park site last September.
'We saw where our potential park might go, and had some serious conversations about what this could mean to our 'turbocharging',' D'Amaro said.
After a return trip to the region in February, D'Amaro said the parties entered into serious discussions that culminated in a deal. The amount of Miral's investment was not disclosed.
Miral Group CEO Mohamed Abdalla Al Zaabi issued a statement hailing the addition of a Disney theme park to Yas Island as a 'historic milestone' in the company's efforts to build the island into a global entertainment destination.",n/a

Already one of the fastest-growing cities in the state, Manteca is now planning on keeping people and bringing the entertainment to them.
Just north of Daniels Street, right next to the Big League Dreams Ballpark Complex and at the western edge of Manteca's city limits, is the area that could soon be called ""the FEZ.""
Right now, the area is zoned and ready for development, but the city wants public input first to see which companies or businesses they can attract.
It's all part of an effort to make people not only visit but hopefully make Manteca their home.
""What it stands for is the 'family entertainment zone,'"" said Manteca Mayor Gary Singh. ""As we know, the city of Manteca is the family city.""
Singh says the city is ready to add to its sprawling footprint in the Central Valley with this next big project.
""Residential growth is here, it's already going on. The question is how do we keep all of those individuals that are living in our community to stay here and spend their money here,"" he said.
Annually, the city says it already brings in over one million visitors to the western side of the city.
Because of the success of the Great Wolf Lodge as well as the Big League Dreams Fields, now the city is hoping to expand by turning these empty fields on the western edge of the city that have sat dormant for years as the next big entertainment zone in San Joaquin County.
""It would be fun for the families. I got two daughters, so now I'd have somewhere to take them,"" said Adrian Rojo.
For Rojo and his growing family, he wants to see the city become that central hub in the Central Valley.
""Kind of tired of driving to Sacramento and Los Angeles and the Bay Area, so I think it would be super dope,"" he said.
In late March, Manteca posted a video to their YouTube channel trying to attract not only developers, but also users and businesses to the area.
The mayor says he and other city leaders are going to a conference next week in Las Vegas to market the FEZ around and see who wants to develop here. The area is already zoned, the mayor says, they're trying to make it as business-friendly as possible.
So how can the community help pick what they want?
The mayor says a survey already went out to some people around the city earlier this year and the results were restaurants, very family restaurant-driven.",n/a

Leaders from across the country and other nations are here this week discussing ways to improve nighttime entertainment options.
Edward Grant, with the City of Dallas, was one of those officials and experts in town. He's introducing the concept of noctourism, which is the creation of more after-hours festivals and entertainment to bring in more money from people from across the region and state.
""They're there for that event, but then they're spending money at your restaurants, they're spending money at your hotels to stay overnight, they're spending money on transportation,"" Grant said.
But increasing crowds at night can also create safety concerns.
""Your potential for something to happen grows, and that's the risk part of it, but it's how we plan, prevent and respond to it that makes a difference,"" Grant said.
Sacramento's nighttime economy manager, Tina Lee-Vogt, says the city is already working to expand evening entertainment options and safety.
""I think, sometimes, that we focus so much on day tourism that we forget about the other 9-5,"" Lee-Vogt said.
Last month, Sacramento created new permits that allow dancing, DJs and live music in places like wine bars, coffee shops and breweries.
The city is also considering allowing people to drink alcohol in special zones outside bars and restaurants.
""I think it's a great idea and it gives the ability to start socializing and to really not worry about pounding that drink as quickly as they normally would,"" Lee-Vogt said.
State lawmakers are also considering a bill that would allow serving alcohol for two extra hours, extending the last call to 4 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.",n/a

The Chinese music streaming giant has heavily invested in long-form content, like podcasts and audiobooks, as part of its bet on the Super VIP (SVIP) program, which bundles high-quality audio, online karaoke and exclusive event access.
This has helped Tencent Music offset weakness in its social entertainment business, impacted by the removal of certain live-streaming features such as virtual lucky draws to comply with Beijing's anti-gambling regulations.
First-quarter revenue from music subscriptions grew 16.6% to 4.22 billion yuan ($586.1 million), while paying users increased by 8.3% to 122.9 million. CEO Ross Liang cited long-form audio as a key driver for SVIP business growth on an earnings call.
U.S.-listed shares of the company were last up 1% after having declined as much as 7% in early trading. The stock has jumped more than 26% so far this year, through the last close.
""The Q1 print is a solid one ... (The stock move) is mostly due to positions, as many investors had expected such strength and bought shares ahead of the earnings. They are now taking profit,"" said Charlie Chai, vice head of research at 86Research.
Revenue rose 8.7% to 7.36 billion yuan in the March quarter, beating estimates of 7.27 billion yuan, according to LSEG data.
Its adjusted profit of 1.37 yuan per American Depository Share (ADS) topped estimates of 1.33 yuan.
""Tencent Music's continued innovation in AI-powered personalization, long-form audio and fan-driven commerce, combined with cost discipline and increased content scale, will support margin expansion and deeper monetization through the second half of 2025,"" said CFRA Research analyst Ahmad Halim.
Revenue from the social entertainment business, which includes karaoke app WeSing and live concert platform Kuwo Music, fell 11.9% to 1.55 billion yuan.

A security image released by the the Douglas County Sheriff's Office from the Main Event shooting shows the scene inside in February.
Douglas County
Nevaeha Crowley-Sanders faces over 100 charges for allegedly shooting wildly inside the business after a fight broke out with a woman she reportedly had conflict with dating back to middle school. Another woman, however, was hit by the gunfire four times.
""I love everyone and I thank the judge so much for paying attention and doing what was right,"" said Crowley-Sanders' mother Trianna Sanders-McNeil. ""This is still going to be a long process, but keep us in your prayers and pray that what needs to come to light will come to light.""
23rd Judicial District Court Judge Elizabeth Volz lowered the bond to a $250,000 cash bond after it had been set at $1 million. The district attorney argued against lowering the bond, saying Crowley-Sanders was a danger to the community and a flight risk.
The incident inside the entertainment complex preceded more trouble outside, where Crowley-Sanders' step-brother Jalin Seabron was shot and killed by an arriving Douglas County Sheriff's deputy.
Investigators said Seabron was pointing that handgun toward several people and refused commands to drop the gun from the deputy, but Seabron's family and their attorney Tyrone Glover dispute claims made by the sheriff's office and say the video contradicts those statements. They say the deputy failed to identify himself as a law enforcement officer and maintain that the shooting was not justified.
23rd Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler has said he has not seen reason to bring charges against the deputy in the case.
""I don't have any charges that I believe I can bring related to the use of deadly force that I'd have a good faith basis for,"" said Brauchler.
Crowley-Sanders' family said they planned to work with bail bondsmen to obtain the money needed to get her out of jail where she could return to her young son. The judge ordered that she wear a GPS monitor while out on bond. Her next court date is in late July.
""Navaeha we cannot wait to receive you back in to the community and we will be with you every step of the way. As you honor yourself and you honor this process,"" said Shofner.",n/a

""Dinosaur time"" is the latest TikTok food trend.
It involves grabbing handfuls of greens like lettuce, spinach or kale, stuffing them into your mouth and then chewing them quickly, mimicking how herbivores ate during the Mesozoic era.

Social media user @sahmthingsup is believed to be behind the viral videos and said on her TikTok account that it's a way to boost your consumption of greens.
""I just grab a large handful. I eat everything I grab,"" she said in part in a post.
The TikTok food trend encourages chewing greens as quickly as possible to get that less palliative task of eating part of your recommended daily quota of vegetables out of the way. You can then move onto eating a more enjoyable meal.
""Dinosaur time is more about the goal than the process,"" the TikTok user shared on her social media site. ""That goal is simply to eat at least a full serving of green veggies before a meal, ideally quickly and whilst channeling a hungry dinosaur.""

Many of the influencer's social media followers seemed excited to incorporate this lifestyle hack into their meal routines. Some said that even their children are asking to eat vegetables now in this dinosaur-style feeding frenzy fashion.
Fox News Digital reached out to the TikTok trendsetter for further comment.

Stefanski said plants are an important source of non-digestible material that helps with elimination in the digestive process.
She also noted these greens provide nutrients like vitamin C and fiber needed for gut health.
""Vegetables also provide a high source of B vitamins, such as folate, which help support our immune systems and decrease the risk of issues such as birth defects and the development of cancer,"" Stefanski told Fox News Digital.

Another expert told Fox News Digital that while she preferred that people enjoy eating vegetables, the trend's focus on consuming green leafy vegetables can have a widespread positive effect.
""Prioritizing veggies is great,"" Caroline Susie, a registered dietitian nutritionist based in Texas, told Fox News Digital. ""Especially since less than 10% of American adults meet the recommended daily intake of vegetables.""
Susie warned that eating greens as quickly as shown in some TikTok videos could lead to discomfort from gas and bloating. She also said that green, leafy vegetables contain fat-soluble vitamins, ""meaning you need to pair a fat with them [for your body] to absorb them.""
Dinosaur time involves eating raw vegetables, which may pose a problem for individuals who do not tolerate raw vegetables as easily as cooked ones, Stefanski noted.

""For individuals with gastrointestinal issues [GI] or those recovering from a GI illness, cooked vegetables may cause less gas and digestive upset,"" she said.

lifestyle,Protein-packed American-grown rice alternative has twice the amount as quinoa,https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/sorghum-farmer-jb.jpg,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/protein-packed-american-grown-rice-alternative-twice-amount-quinoa,"Sorghum is ready for its time in the spotlight.
This made-in-America heritage grain has twice the amount of protein as quinoa, according to experts, and is seeing a sharp spike in interest as consumers seek homegrown products.
From popcorn to biscuits to drought-resistant livestock feed and gluten-free pastries, the grain is a perfect substitute for more traditional grains. It's also jam-packed with antioxidants, fiber and other crucial elements, promoting a balanced, healthy food.
The sorghum belt in America — stretching from South Dakota to Texas — is ""a region that often faces drought and tough growing conditions,"" Lanier Dabruzzi, director of nutrition and food innovation at the United Sorghum Checkoff Program, told Fox News Digital.
""Its ability to thrive with limited water makes it an ideal crop for farmers looking to manage risk and protect long-term productivity.""
While the ancient grain was domesticated in Africa around 8,000 years ago, it has become a staple crop in Kansas, according to the Kansas Grain Sorghum Commission (KGSC).
The grain is drought-tolerant, non-GMO (genetically modified organism) and requires less resources like water and fertilizer than other grain crops.
""This U.S.-grown grain is already a quiet staple in items like whole-grain breads, cereals and granola bars.""
Different varieties of sorghum are grown for different uses.
Grain sorghum can be used for gluten-free baking products, according to the KGSC.
Whole-grain sorghum is a great source of fiber and protein that adds a ""hearty, nutty flavor"" to recipes and can be used in foods like salads, cooked dishes and snacks, according to Sorghum Checkoff.
Forage sorghum is used for feeding livestock, and sweet sorghum is used for creating a syrup that resembles molasses, per the KGSC.
""While many Americans may not recognize it by name, this U.S.-grown grain is already a quiet staple in items like whole-grain breads, cereals, granola bars and baby puffs,"" Dabruzzi said.
""And the innovation doesn't stop there. Sorghum is also making its way into gluten-free baking mixes, prebiotic snacks and even craft beers.""
Sorghum comes in a variety of forms, so its uses are only limited by a person's imagination, according to Sorghum Checkoff.
Sorghum can be used like any other grain or flour, so it's really a matter of substitution.
For any dish needing rice or quinoa or for any baking recipe that calls for traditional flour, try sorghum instead.
""A growing body of evidence shows that eating sorghum can help improve overall health and well-being, when incorporated into a healthy lifestyle,"" Dabruzzi said.
Cooked whole-grain sorghum is a source of tryptophan, an amino acid that research has shown may be an effective approach to decreasing anxiety and increasing positive mood in healthy individuals, according to Dabruzzi.
""A serving of cooked whole-grain sorghum is an excellent source of protein, zinc, selenium and copper, which may contribute to a healthy immune system,"" she said.
Whole-grain sorghum is perfect for soups, pilafs or grain bowls, she said.
""A serving of whole-grain sorghum provides about a whopping 10 grams of plant-based protein, twice the protein as quinoa. It's also higher in protein than an ounce of beef or chicken,"" notes the Cleveland Clinic.

Sorghum flour is ideal for muffins, coating for fried chicken and for thickening gravies and sauces.
Dabruzzi said it can even be popped like popcorn — and it won't get stuck in your teeth.
Unlike rice and similar grains, according to the Cleveland Clinic, sorghum keeps its taste and texture when you freeze and reheat it.
""More consumers are looking for foods that support their health and support American agriculture – and sorghum delivers on both fronts,"" Dabruzzi said.",n/a

The rainy weather returns Tuesday around New York City and the suburbs, with a chance of showers for the rest of the week.
Our First Alert Weather team is tracking when the conditions will be the worst.
Timing out today's rain
CBS News New York
After another stunning stretch of spring weather, it looks like rain is returning to the forecast.
The morning commute wasn't too bad, with just a few drops south and west of the city. And how about those temperatures — right around 60 degrees for many folks.
CBS News New York
For the remainder of the day, the rain will gradually work its way through the city, but it will be in no rush. In fact, some of our northeast suburbs may be completely spared during the daylight hours.
Showers will ultimately overspread the area tonight, however, especially into the overnight hours, so be sure to have the umbrella.
Wet weather will stick around
CBS News New York
Wednesday, unfortunately, will be the wettest day of the week, with more on-than-off showers, which may be moderate to heavy at times. Temperature-wise, it will also be our coolest day of the week, with highs only in the mid 60s.
As for Thursday, it's not looking nearly as wet, but a couple of showers will be around, especially across the interior. It will be a tad warmer, as well, with highs closer to 70.

weather,How National Weather Service staffing shortages are already making weather forecasts worse,https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/13/0fbba07d-ea81-4b17-9049-151a1d5d170d/thumbnail/1200x630/b3c611c09ee05d79e748a7fefef90c32/national-weather-service-office.png?v=1706c0c091b9b085a70a8db995d9c23a,https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/national-weather-service-staffing-shortages-making-forecasts-worse,"There are 122 National Weather Service (NWS) offices nationwide, each of which performs critical lifesaving duties every day from issuing tornado warnings to keeping airplanes out of hazardous weather.
But many NWS offices are now short-staffed, following recent Department of Government Efficiency-ordered staff cuts and voluntary early retirements.
CBS News Chicago found that scaled-back services are already making weather forecasts from your phone to your television less accurate.
""I do think public safety is going to be more in jeopardy,"" said Dr. Richard Spinrad, who served as the Administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the administration of President Barack Obama.
Dr. Richard Spinrad, former NOAA Administrator
Dr. Richard Spinrad
Dr. Spinrad expressed concern that the number of certain employees serving a vital role in local NWS offices, electronics technicians, is down by at least 16%.
""That means the Weather Service's ability to operate, maintain, fix, repair the weather radars is going to be compromised,"" he said.
Meteorologists at television stations use that radar data to help track and forecast dangerous storms during severe weather season.
""There is a high likelihood that through the season, one or two or more radars will not be fully operable at a time that there's a major spate of tornadoes developing,"" Dr. Spinrad said.
That is important as severe weather season ramps up in the Upper Midwest, and studies show that tornado alley is shifting eastward into Illinois as the climate changes.
In 2024, the Chicago area experienced an all-time record 63 tornadoes. Most of those came in back-to-back outbreaks on July 14 and 15.
The staffing shortage could also impact summer vacation travel plans, as the NWS also handles critical airline weather forecasts.
""I expect we're going to see a lot more delays and cancellations due to weather, just because we cannot get the information into the hands of the FAA and the commercial airlines as well,"" said Dr. Spinrad.
CBS News Chicago tried to determine the current extent of staff shortages at weather offices nationwide by calling many offices directly, checking online, and reaching out to the NWS and NOAA.
Local offices referred us to NOAA. NOAA responded via email by writing, ""Per long-standing practice, we don't discuss internal personnel and management matters.""
Online, however, we found that 43% of those 122 weather service offices actually post staffing information — including positions, names, and vacancies that anyone can see.
Dr. Spinrad says the new round of job cuts only exacerbates an existing serious shortage.
""The Weather Service really needed to hire a lot of people, even well before we saw all of these impacts of somewhere in the neighborhood of about 1,500 people now down,"" he said.
Those 1,500 empty jobs are about one-third of the entire NWS workforce.
Indicating there are empty seats in NWS offices, NOAA went on to write, ""The National Weather Service is adjusting some services at our local forecast offices throughout the country in order to best meet the needs of the public…""
One of those services being adjusted is the usual twice-a-day launch of weather balloons from dozens of offices across the country.
A total of 67 NWS offices launch weather balloons, which serve a critical role in weather forecasting. As balloons ascend through the depths of the atmosphere, they feed data into computers that help meteorologists forecast the weather. These data serve to supplement and improve data from satellites and the ground network of weather observing stations.
The weather balloons launched west of Chicago in the Great Plains provide especially valuable information to the CBS News Chicago First Alert Weather team, as most of our weather comes from that direction. The weather team uses that information, along with the most up-to-date weather technology in Chicago, to be able to accurately inform viewers about the risk of severe weather — including tornadoes.
On the day we checked recently, eight of 67 offices were down to one balloon launch a day — many of those located west of Chicago. Another three had canceled launches altogether.
Not having sufficient weather balloon data is like forecasting our next storm with one eye closed.
""The simple logic is that the reason NOAA uses balloons is because they improve the forecast,"" said Dr. Spinrad. ""So therefore, if you take the balloons out, that forecast is going to be degraded.""
Computer modeling expert Dr. Sharan Majumdar from the University of Miami Rosentiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science agrees. He worries about the impact on the 2025 hurricane season, which runs from June through November.
""The National Hurricane Center calls for extra observations to supplement the network when there's a hurricane that's approaching,"" Majumdar said.
Majumdar said data show without extra balloon launches that provide three-dimensional structures of the atmosphere surrounding a storm, hurricane track forecasts are less accurate.
""The computer models need that, that accuracy of data that the satellites cannot provide,"" he said.
With more people moving to or vacationing along the country's coastlines, that accuracy matters.
""The number of people that are just in harm's way, it's always important to keep improving our weather forecasts, and the availability of more observations is only going to improve weather forecasts,"" Dr. Majumdar said.
U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-California), who represents California's 18th Congressional District in the central part of the state near the coastline, is pushing the Trump Administration for answers.
""We have sent six letters … and they refuse to answer them,"" said Rep. Lofgren. ""So not only are they doing irresponsible cuts, but they're hiding what they're doing from the public.""
U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren represents the California 18th Congressional District
U.S. House of Representatives
Lofgren said she has been searching for bipartisan consensus.
""And so far, we have not seen Republican members in the majority willing to join with us to press on this,"" she said. ""I think they're afraid of Trump. I would be more afraid of my constituents being harmed because of those cuts to the weather service.""
NOAA, again, did not respond to our request for specific staffing information, but did write, ""Work is underway to restore services at local forecast offices around the country.""
However, it doesn't appear that vacant NWS positions will be filled soon, as the place to apply for an open spot, USAJOBS, shows no job openings for the National Weather Service.
In the meantime, Dr. Spinrad said NWS employees are doing their best with limited numbers.
""Imagine a defense on a college football team playing with only eight players. They're going to get the job done. They're going to work hard,"" he said. ""I don't care how good they are, they can't compete as well. They can't cover every consequence.""
CBS News Chicago reached out to the Congressional Committee that oversees NOAA and did not hear back. Rep. Lofgren is the ranking Democratic member of that committee.
We also reached out to GOP Rep. Darin LaHood (R-Illinois) of Illinois' 16th Congressional District, and did not hear back.",n/a

Let's back up just a bit and take a look at the upcoming weekend as a whole. There will be one more hurdle to cross between now and Mother's Day.
Another round of rain is on the way. We expect periods of heavy rain Friday afternoon through early Saturday morning.
Many areas will receive between 1-to-2 inches of water leading to more localized street flooding.
Saturday will be a transition day. The first half of the day will be murky with leftover clouds and showers.
The rain will move out by midday and there should be some sunny breaks during the afternoon and evening.

High temperatures on Sunday, May 11, 2025
KDKA Weather Center
Highs will reach the mid-70s to near 80 in most locations with dry and comfortable conditions for those with any outdoor plans.
The cutoff upper-level low we've been monitoring over the Gulf Coast states over the last several days is finally starting to show signs of moving northeastward. This means an end to the clear conditions and more humid, active weather toward the early to middle portion of the week.
Low temperaturs on Sunday night
KDKA Weather Center
That system will lead to an increase in clouds Monday afternoon and evening, followed by showers after sunset Monday, Monday night, and Tuesday. Since the atmosphere will be very saturated on Tuesday, we expect quite a bit of cloud cover and slow temperature decrease with height, which should limit the instability for thunderstorms--so just rain is expected.
On Wednesday afternoon and evening, we may see a few more storms as temperatures aloft cool a bit along with the intrusion of some drier air. However, widespread severe weather is not a concern. On the backside of this system, we may see some areas of dense fog on Thursday morning due to saturated low levels and very light winds.
Monday high temperatures
KDKA Weather Center
This should give way to partly cloudy skies and warmer conditions on Thursday as a short-lived ridge settles in. With the added moisture in the air along with cloud cover, the range between high and low temperatures Tuesday through Thursday won't be much. Lows near 60 with highs in the mid to upper 70s.
Our next weather system of interest will move in by this Friday. A surge of very warm, moist, and unstable air will overspread our region. This, coupled with some stronger jet stream winds aloft, will lead to stronger wind shear that could set up the potential for some severe storms Friday into Friday night, with lingering activity possible on Saturday.
Rain chances over the next seven days

There remains some uncertainty with the exact timing and location since we're still several days away, but the overall large-scale weather pattern does look favorable for some action.

Rain chances stick around on Thursday and Friday, but that rain chance will come from afternoon to evening storm chances. We are already included on the Thursday severe weather risk map (marginal level 1 out of 5). I expect we will also be included under the Friday severe risk map as well. Strong wind is the biggest concern on both days.

Highs should get back to the mid-70s on Wednesday. I have us hitting the 80s for highs on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Temperatures won't be as warm on Sunday, with us just hitting the mid-70s on what looks to now be a dry day overall.

weather,The dry and comfortable weather in Pittsburgh continues through the weekend before rain returns,https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/10/e79739d2-ced6-4d9b-b0a8-b86825a0b6bf/thumbnail/1200x630/1af943bd9696e5e861554acc8197d864/forecasthighs.png?v=e61856d8e666e7ed5709adc37bb2d465,https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/mothers-day-weekend-weather-forecast-pittsburgh,"Cool conditions have settled into the Upper Ohio Valley this weekend as high pressure settles in behind a frontal passage. While temperatures are cool and winds are light enough in spots to support patchy frost, that should quickly become a distant memory as a light westerly, warm and dry wind is expected for Saturday afternoon and evening with ample sunshine.

This should allow afternoon temperatures to max out in the low to mid-70s.
Overnight into Sunday morning, a weak frontal boundary will approach from the northwest. This will really act more like a wind shift boundary and ultimately reinforce the dry, comfortable weather for Sunday. After morning lows in the mid to upper 40s, highs should reach the mid to upper 70s for most spots in the afternoon and evening.
The impact of potential wildfire smoke across Ohio and Pennsylvania
KDKA Weather Center
We will be watching for a band of wildfire smoke to move across Western PA between 6 a.m. and 11 a.m. Sunday. This smoke shouldn't lead to major air quality concerns, but it is attributed to the first wildfires of the season that have erupted in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada.
By Monday, our whole weather pattern will begin to shift as attention turns to an approaching upper low that is currently over the Gulf Coast states. That system will move north, leading to an increase in clouds Monday afternoon and evening, followed by showers Monday night and Tuesday.
High temperatures expected on Sunday, May 11, 2025
KDKA Weather Center
Since the atmosphere will be very saturated on Tuesday, we expect quite a bit of cloud cover and slow temperature decrease with height, which should limit the instability for thunderstorms. On Wednesday afternoon and evening, we may see a few more storms as temperatures aloft cool a bit along with the intrusion of some drier air.
However, severe weather is not a concern.
On the backside of this system, conditions look rather pristine for some areas of dense fog on Thursday morning due to saturated low levels and very light winds. This should give way to partly cloudy skies and warmer conditions on Thursday as a short-lived ridge settles in.
Rain chances over the next week
KDKA Weather Center
Our next weather system of interest will move in by next Friday, into Saturday. A surge of very warm, moist, and potentially unstable air will overspread our region. This, coupled with some stronger winds aloft, could set up the potential for some severe storms.
We are still a week out, so some minor adjustments are possible, but there is a fairly strong signal in the model guidance already that we will be moving into a more active pattern.
